A Practical Diſcourſe OF Confeſſion of Sins TO GOD, As a Means of Pardon and Cleanſing.By JOHN WADE,
1. To His Grace WILLIAM Duke of BEDFORD.

1. THE CONTENTS OF THE Several CHAPTERS in the following Diſcourſe.

1. ERRATA.

#####Body#####

1. A DISCOURSE OF Confeſſion of Sin.

    _ CHAP. I. The Introduction. The Diviſion of the Words. The Doctrine laid down, and the Method propounded for the handling of it. The Nature of Confeſſion open'd, or a Deſcription of it given, containing the Acts or Parts, and the Adjuncts or Properties of Confeſſion.

    _ CHAP. II. Of the former Act of Confeſſion, to wit, Self-Accuſation. Of the Limitation or Reſtriction of the Object in Self-Accuſation, The Sinner accuſeth himſelf of his ſins, and none but himſelf; not God, nor the Devil, nor Ungodly Men.

    _ CHAP. III. Of the Manner of Self-Accuſation; and (1. of particularizing of Sin. He that confeſſes aright, accuſeth himſelf of particular ſins; and eſpecially chargeth himſelf with his particular ſin. He acknowledgeth unknown ſins in a general and implicit Confeſion.

    _ CHAP. IV. Of the ſecond way of Self-Accuſation; namely, as it is made by Aggravation of ſin. The great Neceſſity of Aggravation of ſin. Our Confeſſion cannot be full and compleat without it. There can be no thorow humiliation without it, Several Heads of Aggravation propounded: Among many others, one notable way of Aggravation commended; which is, To take thoſe very thing, which are too commonly made Excuſes and Pleas for ſin, and to turn them into ſo many Aggravations. How to Aggravate our ſins from the littleneſs of them, from the commonneſs of them; from our ignorance in ſinning; from temptations to ſin; and from our ſinful Nature. A notable inſtance of Aggravation of ſin ſhewn in St. Auſtin.

    _ CHAP. V. Of the ſecond Act of Confeſſion; to wit, Self-Condemnation. Self-Condemnation does not at all conſiſt in any willingneſs to go to Hell, or contentedneſs to be Damn'd, but only in a ſerious judging, eſteeming, and acknowledging our ſelves worthy of Hell and Damnation for our ſins. Two Marks or Characters, whereby we may be able to judge of our Self-Judging. If we truly condemn our ſelves for our ſins, then (1.) We ſhall humbly ſubmit to any preſent puniſhment that the hand of God has already laid upon any of us. (2.) We ſhall be willing to bear any further puniſhment, that God ſhall lay at any time upon any of us here in this World. Particularizing and Aggravation have ſome place in Self-Condemning, as well as in Self-Accuſing.

    _ CHAP. VI. The firſt Adjunct or Property of true confeſſion; it is free and voluntary, not forced and conſtrain'd.

    _ CHAP. VII.

    _ CHAP. VIII. The third Property of Confeſſion; it is made with a full Reſolution againſt our ſins. The Hypocrite is Raſh and Self-confident in his Vows; but the humble Confeſſor is fearful and diſtruſtful of himſelf in his Reſolves, and ſeeks to God for ſtrength and power to act his Purpoſes, and perform his Vows.

    _ CHAP. IX. The fourth and laſt Property of true Confeſſion: It is made with an Deſire of, and ſome good Hope in Divine Mercy. The neceſſity of Faith and Hope in a right Confeſſion of Sin upon a double account; becauſe that unbelieving, deſpairing Thoughts, do (1. greatly diſhonour God. (2.) Extreamly deaden and ſtraiten our own Hearts in Confeſſion. A neceſſary Caution; to take one thing with anothe•, and to be ſure to join all theſe Properties of Confeſſion in PracticalƲſe together.

    _ CHAP. X. The Grounds and Reaſons of Confeſſion. Two falſe Grounds of Cofeſſion rejected. We muſt never confeſs our ſins with any intention to give God Information, or to make God Satisfaction by our Confeſſion. An Objection anſwered.

    _ CHAP. XI. Ten poſitive Grounds, and proper Reaſons of the Duty of Confeſſion. (1.) God expreſly commands it. (2.) God is greatly glorified, and juſtified by it. (3.) 'Tis a thing in it ſelf moſt reaſonable and equitable. (4.) Confeſſion of Sin is abſolutely and indiſpenſably neceſſary to Remiſſion of Sin; ſo as that God can't well pardon us without Confeſſion. How it's unbeſeeming the Majeſty, the Juſtice, the Mercy, the Wiſdom, the Holineſs of God, for God to pardon and forgive the Sinner, before and without the Confeſſion and Acknowledgment of his ſin. (5.) Confeſſion of Sin is it ſelf a proper act of Mortification. (6.) Confeſſion teſtifies unto God, and evidences unto our ſelves the ſincerity and unfeignedneſs of our Repentance, and gives us good aſſurance that we are in a fair way of Recovery. (7.) Confeſſion eaſes our troubled Spirits, and disburdens our oppreſſed Conſciences. (8.) It were unreaſonable Folly in us to go about to hide any ſins from God; and the wiſeſt way to conceal them from othe•s, is to diſcover them to God. (9.) It's no: only a fooliſh, but an unſate and hazardous, a deſperate and dangerous thing, for any to attempt to hide and conceal their ſins from God. (10) And laſtly; Confeſſion of Sin, or Self-accuſing, and Self-judging, it happily prevents or weakens all Satan's Accuſations, and ſurely foreſtalls the juſt Sentence and Judgment of the great Judge at the laſt Day.

    _ CHAP. XII. The Application of the Doctrine. The firſt Ʋſe, by way of Confutation of the Popiſh Doctrine of Auricular Confeſſion.

    _ CHAP. XIII. The ſecond Ʋſe, of Examination and Reproof together.

    _ CHAP. XIV. The Third Ʋſe, of Exhortation. Three Motives taken out of the Text: (1.) If we confeſs, God will forgive us our ſins. (2.) He will alſo cleanſe us from all our unrighteouſneſs. What is meant by Cleanſing. This Benefit nothing inferior to the former. (3.) God's Faithfulneſs and Juſtice do ſtand engag'd to make good the promiſed Bleſſings to us. God condeſcends to confirm his Promiſes, becauſe there are two things which make us prone to diſtruſt, eſpecially his Pardoning Mercy: (1.) Our own contrary Nature and Practiſe. (2.) The due conſideration of our heinous Sins and high Provocations.

    _ CHAP. XV. A double Direction, by way of Preparation to the Duty of Confeſſion. (1.) Premeditate as much as you can, in order to Confeſſion. (2.) Be ſure to look up unto God for Conviction.

    _ CHAP. XVI. Directions given concerning ſome Circumſtances of the very Performance of this Duty. (1.) Concerning the Time and Seaſon of Confeſſion. (1.) Confeſs continually. (2.) Confeſs daily. The Equity and Advantage of ſo doing. (3.) And more particularly; Confeſs whenever you lye under any notable Conviction. (4.) Confeſs whenever you lye under any notable Affliction. (5.) Confeſs preſently upon the Commiſſion of any great ſin. (6.) Confeſs preſently upon the Receipt of any great Mercy. (2.) Concerning the Place where we ſhould confeſs. Let's eſpecially confeſs our ſins in ſecret; and that for a threefold Reaſon. (1.) Becauſe private Confeſſion is plainly neceſſary. (2.) 'Tis very convenient: There is a double Advantage in it. (3.) The moſt Secret is likely to be the most Sincere Confeſſion.

    _ CHAP. XVII. Further Directions, reſpecting and ordering our Carriage and Behaviour after the Duty. (1.) Haſt thou confeſs'd? Then bleſs God who has enabled thee to confeſs. (2). Haſt thou confeſs'd, and ſo perform'd the Condition? Then apply the Promiſe to thy ſelf, and make good Ʋſe of it in time of Temptation. (3.) Haſt thou confeſs'd? Then daily plead the Promiſe with God, and carefully look after the Performance of it. (4.) Haſt thou confeſs'd, and found and felt the Benefit of it? Why then, give God the Praiſe that is due to him. (5.) Haſt thou confeſs'd thy ſins? Then take great heed of falling into ſin after Confeſſion. And here, (1.) Take heed of falling wilfully into any ſin after Confeſſion. (2.) Beware, eſpecially, that you fall not wilfully into the ſame particular ſins you have confeſs'd: For, (1.) There is great danger of it. Danger, (1.) To the formal Confeſſor, in four reſpects. (2.) Danger too to the Penitent Confeſſor: (1.) From Satan. (2.) The greateſt danger from our own Corruption. (2.) There is great Evil and Folly in it; great Guilt and Danger by reaſon
 of it. For (1.) falling into ſin after Confeſſion does exceedingly aggravate the ſin. Sin after Confeſſion, a great ſin in three reſpects. (2.) As this is a great ſin, ſo it brings along with it great Puniſhment; both internal and external Puniſhments. (3.) Sinning wilfully after Confeſſion, will make you Self-condemn'd when God puniſheth you. (4.) 'Twill break our preſent Peace, and daſh our Hopes of future and further Comfort. (5.) Thou wilt thus cut out for thy ſelf new Work, and make the Severities of a New Repentance neceſſary. (6.) Falling into ſin after Confeſſion, will make us the more unapt and unable to riſe again, and recover out of it; it will ſtrengthen Sin, and weaken Grace in us. (7.) 'Twill very much diſhearten us, when we would beg Pardon of our ſin, and hugely diſcourage us when we would renew our Reſolution againſt it. (8.) 'Twill make God loth ever to take your Word again, and will render him harder to Pardon you upon a new Confeſſion.

    _ CHAP. XVIII. Some Means or Helps for the ſhunning and avoiding of Sins confeſs'd. (1.) Let ſuch as have formerly confeſs'd their Sins without any true Senſe of Sin, now labour ſpeedily to get a deep and thorow Conviction of the Evil of their Sins. (2.) Let ſuch as have confeſs'd their Sins, with a true Senſe of Sin upon their Spirits, obſerve and practiſe theſe following Rules, (1.) Labour to preſerve and maintain in the courſe of thy Life the ſame Apprehenſions thou hadſt of thy Sin in any former ſerious and ſolemn Confeſſion. (2). Seriouſly conſider and remember, that thou, art at preſent in Dependance upon God for Mercy, and art very fair for't. (3.) Be always imploring Divine Aſſiſtance, and improving your own Endeavours againſt your Sins.

    _ CHAP. XIX. This fifth Direction concluded with a double Caution. (1.) While we take heed of falling on the one ſide, into the ſame particular ſin we confeſs'd; let us alſo beware of falling on the other ſide, into the contrary ſin to that we confeſs'd. (2.) If through ſtrength of Corruption, or violence of Temptation, thou ſhouldſt at any time fall into the ſame ſin again, thou muſt not for all this run into Deſpair; but thou muſt renew thy Confeſſion as thou reneweſt thy Tranſgreſſion, This gives no Licenſe at all to ſin, but is the beſt Preſervative and Antidote againſt it.

    _ CHAP. XX. The ſixth and last Direction; Have we confeſs'd our ſins to God, that we might be forgiven them by God? Let us then freely forgive thoſe that have treſpaſs'd againſt us, upon their Confeſſion of their faults to us; and ſo forgive them, as to profeſs and and teſtify to them our pardoning of them.

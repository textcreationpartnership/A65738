            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </p>
               <p>I ſhall ſpeak to two things out of this <hi>Definition;</hi> wherein you have chiefly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable,</p>
               <p n="1">1. A <hi>Limitation</hi> or Reſtriction of the <hi>Object</hi> in <hi>Self-Accuſation.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. A <hi>Declaration</hi> of the <hi>Manner</hi> of <hi>Self-Accuſation</hi> in a truly humble <hi>Confeſſion.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Object</hi> in Confeſſional Self-Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, The <hi>Sinner himſelf, and none but himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Manner</hi> is double:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Sinner charges himſelf with his ſins as <hi>particularly</hi> as he can.</p>

               <p n="2">2. By <hi>aggravation</hi> of our ſins before <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. You have here a <hi>Limitation,</hi> or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction of the <hi>Object</hi> in <hi>Self-Accuſation:</hi> The Sinner accuſes <hi>himſelf</hi> of his ſins, charges <hi>himſelf</hi> with his ſins, and <hi>none but himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He very truly and juſtly draws up a Bill of Indictment, and puts it in himſelf <hi>only againſt himſelf.</hi> He Fathers not one ſin upon <hi>God;</hi> he's far from making his God the Author of his ſins, or imputing them to his <hi>Decree</hi> and <hi>Predetermination;</hi> he declares <hi>God</hi> to be <hi>righteous,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces <hi>himſelf</hi> a <hi>Sinner:</hi> He accuſes not <hi>God,</hi> neither does he accuſe the <hi>Devil,</hi> or <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly Men,</hi> for his ſins. Moſt Men think the <hi>Devil's</hi> back broad enough to bear theirs and therefore they eaſe and disburden themſelves, and heavily load him, by ſhifting off all their ſins to him, and laying all of them upon his Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as if <hi>Satan</hi> hadn't only the <hi>Subtilty</hi> and Cunning of <hi>perſwading,</hi> but the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>forcing</hi> and compelling. How many are there that think they are quite freed
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:35226:18"/> and wholly diſcharged, ſo ſoon as they have charged <hi>Satan,</hi> and accuſed <hi>Wicked Men?</hi> That make account they have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or nothing to anſwer for, becauſe <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> tempted them, becauſe <hi>Wicked Men</hi> entic'd and importun'd them, becauſe bad Company and evil Counſel drew them away? That look upon themſelves as clear, when once they have alienated and transferr'd their fault, when they have turn'd off their ſins to ſome one elſe, and devolv'd them upon another? You find <hi>Aaron</hi> had too well learn'd this kind of <hi>Tranſlation;</hi> who being juſtly challeng'd by <hi>Moſes</hi> for making the <hi>Golden Calf,</hi> and ſharply reprov'd by him for his ſin, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently lays all the blame upon the <hi>People,</hi> as if he ſhould have gone Scot-free, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they put him upon't. See this in the 32 <hi>Exod.</hi> 21, 22, 23, <hi>v.</hi> Do but mind what <hi>Aaron</hi> ſays here, and you'll ſee it's a <hi>meer ſhift</hi> indeed: <hi>Thou knoweſt,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the people, that they are ſet on miſchieft, for they ſaid unto me, make us Gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They ſaid unto me;</hi> ſhould he dare to do what they bad him? But they were <hi>ſet on't,</hi> ſays he; why this rather <hi>makes againſt</hi> him, for the more the People were <hi>ſet</hi> on miſchief, the more it behov'd him
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:35226:18"/> to <hi>withſtand</hi> and oppoſe it; and probably, had he zealouſly <hi>ſet himſelf againſt it,</hi> the <hi>Golden Calf</hi> had never been made; had he but roundly took them up, and ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chid them ſor't, it's likely he might have prevented the Miſchief. However, had he but done his Duty, had he been ſo far from <hi>conſenting</hi> to't, as openly and publickly to have declared and manifeſted his <hi>abhorring</hi> and deteſtation of the Fact, he had'nt then involv'd himſelf in the guilt of ſo ſoul a ſin: Yet hadn't a free, <hi>ingenuous Confeſſion,</hi> a great deal better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Aaron,</hi> after he had ſinn'd, than ſo <hi>abſurd</hi> and <hi>dull a put-off,</hi> ſo poor and ſilly a ſhift, ſo idle and frivolous; and, which is worſt of all, ſo <hi>ſinful</hi> an <hi>Excuſe? Saul</hi> too had the ſame <hi>Excuſe</hi> ready at's fingers ends, when <hi>Samuel</hi> came to him, and charg'd him with ſparing the beſt of the Spoil which he had taken from the <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lekites,</hi> when as God had expreſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to ſlay all; (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.) why ſtraight he excuſes himſelf by accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of others, <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>They,</hi> ſays he, <hi>have brought them from the Amalekites, for the people ſpared the beſt of the Sheep, and of the Oxen, to ſacrifice unto the Lord thy God, and the reſt we have utterly deſtroyed.</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:35226:19"/> Mark here, when he ſpeaks of what was done according to the will of God, then he puts himſelf in, <hi>the reſt we have utterly deſtroyed;</hi> but when he ſpeaks of what was done againſt God's command, there he leaves himſelf out, he would ſeem to have had nothing to do in't; he quite ſhuffles it off from himſelf, and faſtens it all on the People: <hi>They, the people, ſpared the beſt of the ſheep:</hi> And he thought he had now fairly rid his hands of his ſin. So that when <hi>Samuel</hi> again urg'd him, <hi>Wherefore haſt thou not obey'd the voice of the Lord? (v.</hi> 19.) Inſtead of an <hi>humble Confeſſion</hi> of his ſin, he ſtill defended and <hi>juſtified</hi> himſelf, until by <hi>Samuel's</hi> ſecond reply, a <hi>forced</hi> acknowledgment was <hi>wrung</hi> and extorted from him. Thus <hi>naturally</hi> apt are the Sons of Men, not only to <hi>ſin</hi> with their <hi>firſt Parents,</hi> but with them likewiſe to <hi>excuſe</hi> their ſin, and to find <hi>another</hi> to caſt the fault upon beſides them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves! Read but the Story of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi>'s firſt tranſgreſſion, and you ſhall ſee <hi>where</hi> they learn'd it: <hi>The Woman</hi> (ſays <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> when he had eaten of the forbidden fruit) <hi>the Woman that thou gaveſt to be with me, ſhe gave me, and I did eat. She gave me:</hi> He confidently blames <hi>Eve</hi> for his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:35226:19"/> own ſin; nay, he obliquely charges, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently calumniates <hi>even God himſelf.</hi> The <hi>Woman that thou gaveſt to be with me, ſhe gave me.</hi> Look you here how unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily he <hi>aſperſes God,</hi> as if <hi>God himſelf</hi> had really had an hand in his ſin. And <hi>Eve</hi> too, ſhe ſmoothly and handſomly (as ſhe thought) puts it off to the <hi>Devil:</hi> The Serpent, <hi>the Serpent beguiled me and I did eat, (Gen.</hi> 3.) but never a word of <hi>Self-Accuſation</hi> fell from either of them.</p>
               <p>Too too many in the World have <hi>imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated,</hi> and taken after their <hi>firſt Father</hi> and <hi>Mother</hi> in this very particular; have <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their tranſgreſſions with Adam,</hi> (to uſe <hi>Job</hi>'s expreſſion) <hi>and hid their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in their boſom, (Job</hi> 21.33.) Have made uſe of ſome one elſe to be a <hi>Cloak</hi> and a Covering for their ſins; have ever boldly <hi>juſtified</hi> themſelves; in their <hi>hearts</hi> at leaſt, have ſometimes charged <hi>God;</hi> and often made the <hi>Devil,</hi> not only the <hi>greateſt,</hi> but, I may ſay, the <hi>only Sinner</hi> in the World.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:35226:20"/> that thus charge him the greateſt Devils of the twain.</hi> But truly, tho' Men do the <hi>Devil</hi> great <hi>wrong</hi> in it, yet he thinks not much at it; they never <hi>pleaſure</hi> him more than in ſo doing; he cares not <hi>how much</hi> the Sinner lays upon <hi>him,</hi> ſo he lay but <hi>little</hi> or <hi>nothing</hi> upon <hi>himſelf;</hi> he knows God will one day lay it <hi>heavy enough</hi> upon him. The <hi>Devil</hi> perceives very well what great and ſingular <hi>advantages</hi> he has gotten of thoſe Men, whom he has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to take up and entertain this <hi>fond Conceit,</hi> whom he has fully poſſeſs'd and inveigl'd with this ſtrange, yet pleaſing Miſapprehenſion, that <hi>he is chiefly guilty</hi> of their ſins, for by this means he cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly and ſlily keeps them off from a found and thorow Repentance, and a free, and full, and humble acknowledgment of their ſins to God.</p>
               <p>If any ſuch confeſs at all, I dare ſay, that which is <hi>really</hi> and indeed their ſin, is <hi>ſeldom</hi> the ſubject matter of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; for you ſhall have them in their Confeſſions complain <hi>chiefly</hi> of their <hi>lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs,</hi> and expoſedneſs unto, and of the <hi>ſtrength,</hi> violence, prevalency, and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtableneſs of their <hi>Temptations; more of this</hi> than of the <hi>power</hi> and height of their
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:35226:20"/> inherent, <hi>in-dwelling Luſts</hi> and <hi>Corruptions.</hi> They'll, it may be, pretend to be greatly deſirous of a ſpeedy deliverance from their <hi>Temptations,</hi> when as yet they are utterly careleſs of being freed from the <hi>baſeneſs</hi> and falſeneſs of their own <hi>Hearts;</hi> but were ſuch wholly exempted from the <hi>Temptations</hi> of the <hi>Devil,</hi> or any elſe, yet they have that within their <hi>own Breaſts</hi> would quickly hurry them on to ſin <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Tempter.</hi> This, alas! they don't la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; they'll bewail before God, how they're ſubject unto, and compaſs'd about with <hi>divers temptations,</hi> which even <hi>Chriſt himſelf</hi> was, who yet was <hi>without ſin.</hi> If any will call this lying fair for temptation an <hi>Infelicity,</hi> yet who can ſay, it is a <hi>Sin?</hi> Thus, in effect, and if we ſearch it to the bottom, we ſhall find it to be ſo, they ſondly and fooliſhly Charge even <hi>God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> with their ſins who <hi>ſuffers</hi> them to be tempted, and accuſe the <hi>Devil</hi> that tempts them <hi>much rather</hi> than <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi>

               <p>THE other thing we propounded to ſpeak of touching <hi>Self-Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> was, the <hi>Manner</hi> of it, which I told you was double; and that it was made (1.) by <hi>Particularizing,</hi> (2.) by <hi>Aggravating</hi> of thoſe ſins which we know we ſtand guilty of before God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He that confeſſes aright charges him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with his ſins as <hi>particularly</hi> as he can. <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of ſin, made in general terms only, either through a Man's <hi>ignorance,</hi> or <hi>groſs forgetfulneſs</hi> of his ſins; or with an <hi>intention</hi> to hide and <hi>conceal</hi> them; ſuch a general Confeſſion is a ſinful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion indeed. The ſincere Confeſſor
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:35226:23"/> contents not himſelf with meer Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, but deſcends to Particulars. And truly, ſhould he not do <hi>this,</hi> he would even do juſt <hi>nothing.</hi> Pray, do but a little examine a <hi>General</hi> Confeſſion, ſearch it a while but to the bottom, and ſee but thorowly what is in't once, and then make the <hi>beſt</hi> you can of it, you'll be forc'd to tell me, it's a very poor, <hi>empty, formal thing,</hi> ſuch as, perhaps, ſome <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal hypocrite</hi> may put off his Conſcience for a time with; but yet ſuch, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely offended, <hi>provoked God,</hi> will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be put off with. I'll briefly ſhew you the <hi>vanity</hi> of it. Suppoſe a Man, to uſe no other than a <hi>General</hi> Confeſſion, tho' <hi>this Man</hi> grow every day <hi>worſe and worſe,</hi> tho' he never comes into God's preſence, but he brings the guilt of new ſins along with him, yet <hi>this Man's</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is always the <hi>ſame,</hi> tho' his ſins be not the ſame, tho' his ſins be <hi>many more</hi> than they were, and his guilt far <hi>greater,</hi> and heavier than ever. The Man acknowledges himſelf in nothing worſe now than he was many Years ſince, he puts nothing in his Confeſſion now, but what he put in it then; tho' he daily adds ſin unto ſin, yet he never
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:35226:24"/> adds any thing to h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In truth, he never makes himſelf in in any Confeſſion <hi>worſe</hi> than the <hi>very beſt</hi> are; he never ſays any more againſt <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And further take notice, That he that truly confeſſes, charges himſelf as with <hi>particular</hi> ſins, ſo to be ſure with <hi>his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> ſin. I ſay, let me add this further, That he that truly confeſſes, as he makes a Catalogue of <hi>particular</hi> ſins, ſo to be ſure he puts into the Catalogue <hi>his very particular</hi> ſin; that ſin of his, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the reſt he nay moſt properly and truly call <hi>his own;</hi> that <hi>peccatum in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciis,</hi> that ſin he has ſo <hi>indulg'd</hi> and cocker'd; that very ſin, which above all others he has a long time <hi>moſt pleas'd</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with, and <hi>allowed</hi> himſelf in.</p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:35226:26"/>
               <p>And truly, herein lies a great and main difference between the <hi>humble, ſincere,</hi> and the <hi>formal hypocritical</hi> Confeſſor: The <hi>formal,</hi> hypocritical Confeſſor, he'll willingly confeſs ſin in the <hi>general;</hi> he cares not much, if he calls himſelf Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner before God. Nay, it may be, he'll not ſtick to repeat, and run over ſome common <hi>Heads,</hi> to reckon up to God a few ſorts and kinds of ſins; as his Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, his Actual ſins; his ſins againſt God, his ſins againſt his Neighbor; his ſins of Omiſſion, his ſins of Commiſſion; which is but a <hi>general</hi> Confeſſion yet. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that he can ſo eaſily bring himſelf to that, is, becauſe <hi>Generalia non pungunt; Generals</hi> don't touch to the quick, don't wound, prick, and gall him, don't come <hi>cloſe</hi> and home to him, don't ſo nearly concern him; and therefore <hi>thus</hi> he can confeſs over and over, with very little or no trouble and diſturbance to himſelf at all; <hi>thus</hi> he can confeſs his ſins, yet <hi>keep his ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If ever the hollow-hearted Confeſſor come ſo far as to <hi>particularize</hi> ſins at all, likely he takes ſome <hi>ſly</hi> courſe, he goes ſome <hi>By-way</hi> to Work. He'll often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in ſome particular ſins, which the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:35226:27"/> 
                  <hi>Godly themſelves</hi> daily complain of, which the deareſt of God's People cannot but own and acknowledge. As thus: He'll, it may be, confeſs unto God the weakneſs of his Faith, his want of growth in Grace, which may be an Article in the <hi>beſt</hi> Chriſtian's <hi>Self-Accuſation;</hi> but here is this <hi>deceit</hi> in't, That he that has'nt one <hi>Dram</hi> of Faith, one <hi>Spark</hi> of Grace in him, would yet ſeem to have, and ſuppoſes in himſelf ſome lower, weaker actings, at leaſt, of ſaving, juſtifying Faith; ſome ſmaller degree and meaſure of true, real, ſanctifying Grace. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Hypocrite puts in, commonly he, on purpoſe leaves out of the Charge his <hi>near</hi> and <hi>dear,</hi> tho' never ſo <hi>groſs</hi> and heinous ſin; <hi>this</hi> he'll not be known of, he'll not diſcloſe, he'll not out with <hi>this,</hi> for <hi>this</hi> he reſolves with himſelf never to <hi>part</hi> with; he has no mind to leave it, and therefore he has no heart to confeſs it. He declines and waves all <hi>hard</hi> words of his <hi>own</hi> ſin; whatever he ſays, he'll not have a word of his ſecret Atheiſm, and Profaneneſs of Heart, of his cloſe Hypocriſie and Formality, of his wilful Impenitency and Unbelief, of his falſe Hopes and ungrounded Preſumption: He
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:35226:27"/> forbears the mentioning of his Spiritual Pride, of his Carnal Confidence, and reſting in Duties, of his Self-love, of his Worldly-mindedneſs. This <hi>guileful,</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til, <hi>Semi-confitent,</hi> purpoſely, and induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, keeps in that very ſin, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theſe, or other particular ſins, is <hi>his moſt proper and peculiar ſin;</hi> he's mute and ſilent here; he ſcarce ever comes nigh that <hi>main ſin</hi> which divides and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates between God and his Soul, and keeps off his Heart from <hi>entirely</hi> cloſing with Jeſus Chriſt. His <hi>talk,</hi> (I think I miſcal not his Confeſſion) his talk, I ſay, is uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly far enough from that: Thus <hi>Lapwing-like,</hi> he raiſes his Note <hi>higheſt,</hi> and makes the greateſt noiſe <hi>furtheſt off</hi> his <hi>own Neſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now on the other ſide, the truly humble, broken, penitent Sinner, he's of an honeſt, ingenuous, <hi>guileleſs</hi> ſpirit; in accuſing of himſelf, he deals moſt <hi>freely</hi> and openly with his God; he hides and covers <hi>nothing</hi> from him; he plainly lays open to God his very <hi>darling, boſom</hi> ſin, and readily diſcovers his moſt inward and retir'd Luſt: He is ſo far from concealing <hi>this</hi> in his Confeſſion, that, of all others, he is moſt careful to detect it, and makes
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:35226:28"/> it his buſineſs to inſiſt <hi>ofteneſt</hi> and <hi>largelieſt</hi> on it. And certainly, he that does thus, confeſſes aright; for he that charges himſelf particularly with his <hi>moſt beloved,</hi> ſecret, and hidden ſin, is, no queſtion, in a conſtant <hi>readineſs</hi> to charge himſelf with <hi>all,</hi> to charge himſelf with every one.</p>
               <p>And thus much for the firſt way of Self-Accuſation in Confeſſion; to wit, <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularizing</hi> of our ſins.</p>

               </head>
               <p>I Come now to the ſecond way of <hi>Self-Accuſation,</hi> namely, as it is made by <hi>Aggravation</hi> of ſin: The Sinner charges himſelf with his ſins, by <hi>height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> and <hi>aggravating</hi> them with their
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:35226:30"/> moſt <hi>heinous</hi> and <hi>notorious circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, indeed, the <hi>aggravating circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances</hi> of our ſins, muſt not by any means be neglected in our Confeſſions, for then we ſhould make Confeſſion but by the <hi>halfs;</hi> with the Unjuſt Steward in the Goſpel, we ſhould ſet down but fifty for an hundred: Nay, we ſhould often leave out of our Confeſſions more than we put into them; we ſhould ev'n ſet down but <hi>Pence</hi> for <hi>Pounds,</hi> but <hi>Mites</hi> for <hi>Talents:</hi> For tho' in <hi>Natural</hi> things, <hi>accidents</hi> are nothing in compariſon of the <hi>form,</hi> yet it's a true Rule, that <hi>in moralibus circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantia plus valet quam forma;</hi> in <hi>Moral</hi> things the <hi>Circumſtance</hi> is often more than the <hi>meer Action</hi> it ſelf. Thus it is in the caſe of ſin; the <hi>aggravating Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances</hi> of our ſins often riſe and amount to more than our ſins, barely and ſimply in <hi>themſelves</hi> conſidered. <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances</hi> are to <hi>Actions,</hi> much like what <hi>Ciphers</hi> are to <hi>Figures,</hi> which quickly make (1) (the very <hi>leaſt</hi> of all Figures, but the <hi>beginning</hi> of Numbers) by being placed with it, ſtand for a 1000, an 100000; and therefore for thee to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs thy ſin without it's <hi>appendant Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:35226:30"/> it is at <hi>beſt</hi> to ſay the <hi>leaſt</hi> thou canſt of thy ſin; nay, to <hi>hide</hi> any notable Circumſtance in thy Confeſſions, it is in <hi>effect</hi> even to <hi>cover</hi> thy ſin. Thus you ſee our Confeſſions of our ſins can't be full and compleat, without the aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating Circumſtances of our ſins; for <hi>ſinful Circumſtances</hi> are the <hi>moſt,</hi> are the <hi>greateſt part</hi> of our ſins; without theſe, our ſins are comparatively but little and light: Theſe are they that ſwell, and double, and treble the Accounts, that encreaſe and enlarge the Bill, that thicken and lengthen the Catalogue.</p>
               <p>Beſides, leave but theſe out of thy Confeſſion, and thou wilt not be <hi>thorowly humbled</hi> in thy Confeſſion, thou wilt not be deeply affected with thy ſins in thy Confeſſion; thy ſins won't prick thee at thy Heart, won't cut and wound thee in thy Confeſſions: Now as we all wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our ſelves with our ſins in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of them, (tho' we did not, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, preſently feel that wound) ſo we ſhould wound our ſelves with our ſins in the Confeſſion of them, (and, indeed, <hi>this wound</hi> tends to <hi>healing,</hi> whereas the <hi>other</hi> tended to <hi>Death</hi>) but our ſins, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their <hi>Circumſtances,</hi> are as a Sword
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:35226:31"/> without an <hi>Edge;</hi> the <hi>Circumſtances</hi> of ſin, they give it an <hi>edge,</hi> they make it ſharp, keen and piercing: By means of <hi>theſe,</hi> we are very much mov'd and wrought upon in our Confeſſions, and <hi>ſoundly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled</hi> for our ſins when we ſpread them before the Lord. Thus much for a touch of the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of Aggravation of Sin, as being <hi>abſolutely neceſſary</hi> to Confeſſion of Sin.</p>
               <p>Now as the Duty is in it ſelf <hi>neceſſary,</hi> ſo the Performance of it is the great care and ſerious ſtudy of every Penitent Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; who is ſo far from <hi>diſguiſing,</hi> mask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, vizarding, or palliating his ſin, that he brings it in, and makes it appear in it's <hi>own ſhape,</hi> in its proper and <hi>natural Colours.</hi> He acknowledges his ſins to be <hi>Scarlet</hi> ſins, <hi>Camel</hi> ſins; to be ſins of the <hi>greateſt Magnitude,</hi> of the <hi>deepeſt Dye.</hi> He does dot <hi>ſavour</hi> his ſin in the leaſt, he ſtudies to make it as <hi>bad</hi> as it is in <hi>it ſelf:</hi> He readily owns all that in <hi>his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſin,</hi> which he acknowledges to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the ugly nature of <hi>Sin in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral:</hi> He ſtrives to make the <hi>very worſt</hi> he can of it: He is <hi>ſevere</hi> and impartial in Self-Accuſing: He ſays <hi>as much</hi> againſt

                  <hi>I am a moſt notorious Sinner, as if I were born to no other end than to confeſs, and repent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is is not here impertinent to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the ſeveral <hi>Heads</hi> of Aggravation, with which the Penitent Sinner <hi>amplifies</hi> and exaggerates his ſins in his Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. I might inſtance in theſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that he has ſinned <hi>wilfully</hi> and voluntarily; and this may contain two very great aggravations in it:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That he has ſinn'd wilfully <hi>againſt Light</hi> and Knowledge; as againſt the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Light of Nature; againſt the clear Light of the Sacred Scripture; againſt the Light of good Education; againſt the Light of the Preaching of the Goſpel; againſt the Light of his own Experiences; againſt the Light of the wholſom Counſels, ſober Admonitions, and ſeaſonable Reproofs of Chriſtian, Well-wiſhing Friends.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:35226:32"/>2. He aggravates his ſins from the <hi>wilfulneſs</hi> of them, in that he has ſinn'd as againſt his Knowledge, ſo <hi>upon no Temptation,</hi> or upon <hi>very little</hi> Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; in that he has ſinn'd without any <hi>Illecebra</hi> from <hi>without,</hi> without any <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centive</hi> but from <hi>himſelf.</hi> And, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, this is as <hi>humbling</hi> an Aggravation as can be; that I have ſinn'd, when it was <hi>eaſie</hi> for me to have forborn ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; that I ſinn'd when I was neither blinded with Ignorance, nor tranſported with Paſſion, nor over-born with any kind of Temptation; but did this and that <hi>deliberately,</hi> and out of Choice, ſometimes ſtudying and contriving how I might ſin moſt handſomly, and often ſeeking out Companions, Occaſions, and Inflammations of my Luſts.</p>
               <p>This Aggravation of ſinning without any Temptation, or with very little Temptation, is hugely neceſſary for <hi>ſuch,</hi> as in ordinary buying and ſelling will Lye and Cheat for a Farthing; for <hi>ſuch,</hi> as in common Talk will Swear out of an idle Cuſtom, or for a vain Compliment, as if an <hi>Oath</hi> were the <hi>Enamel</hi> of a Speech,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:35226:33"/> the handſomeſt grace of a Sentence, the chief and only thing that makes it come off cleverly. And truly, among all the ſins in the World, there is ſcarce any one of them m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re <hi>Temptation-leſs</hi> than <hi>Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Swearing.</hi> But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond Topick of Aggravation may be this: He aggravates his ſins as from his <hi>wilfulneſs</hi> in ſinning; ſo from his <hi>ſinning againſt the Means</hi> which God has us'd to reduce and reclaim him from his ſins, namely, In that he has ſinn'd againſt the Motions and Strivings, Helps and Aſſiſtances of God's good and holy Spirit, ſinned againſt the <hi>Divine Mercies,</hi> both General and Special, both Temporal and Spiritual: or in that he has ſinn'd againſt the <hi>Divine Judgments,</hi> either National or Perſonal, either feared or felt, either threatned or already inflicted.</p>
               <p>But the Penitent Sinner chiefly, and eſpecially, aggravates his ſins from their being committed againſt <hi>intermixed</hi> and <hi>interwoven Mercies;</hi> againſt the Mercies of God's Mercies, and the Mercies of his Judgments <hi>compounded,</hi> conjoin'd and united, combin'd and conjugated in his wiſeſt and moſt Providential Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:

O! this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of having ſinn'd againſt <hi>mixed Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> muſt needs mightily humble a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in his Confeſſions; who can chuſe but lie low before God, if he be truly ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of <hi>this</hi> heinous Aggravation of his ſins?</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Penitent Sinner aggravates his ſins, not only from his abuſing of <hi>thoſe</hi> Means which <hi>God</hi> has us'd to reſtore and recover him, but alſo from his fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and making ineſſectual <hi>thoſe</hi> Means which <hi>he himſelf</hi> has ſometimes uſed with himſelf, for the correcting and amending of himſelf; from his ſinning againſt the many Ties, Engagements, and Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which not only God, but he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf has ſeveral times laid upon himſelf to the contrary: from his ſinning againſt his very Confeſſions of Sins, againſt his own Sacramental, Sick-Bed, Occaſional Vows, Covenants, Promiſes, and Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:35226:34"/> againſt his ſins. And <hi>this</hi> is an <hi>high</hi> Aggravation, taken from the <hi>greateſt Folly and Madneſs</hi> that poſſibly a Man can be guilty of: That notwithſtanding I have ſometime ſaid of my ſin, that it was a <hi>very evil,</hi> and a <hi>very bitter thing</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged ſo much in the very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, and there <hi>reſolv'd</hi> againſt it, yet <hi>after all this,</hi> I ſhould really love, like, and chuſe that, which not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I profeſs'd I hated, loath'd, deteſted, and ſolemnly condemn'd my former Choice of.</p>
               <p>The ſerious due application of this Conſideration, will very much conduce to the Sinner's ſound Humiliation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Among other aggravations of ſin, you'll find it to be none of the leaſt, which may be taken from our former <hi>excuſing</hi> and pleading for our ſins: Thou may'ſt well <hi>aggravate</hi> thy ſins from thy having <hi>excus'd</hi> thy ſins: Say, Lord, I wilfully committed this and that ſin, and ſtudied to <hi>leſſen</hi> and lighten it when I had done: I did <hi>very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:35226:35"/>
               <p>Let us aggravate our ſins from our having excus'd them, and from the <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> and <hi>ſinfulneſs</hi> of our <hi>Pleas</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes.</hi> For inſtance: Haſt thou excus'd thy ſin, by ſaying it was a <hi>little one,</hi> and a ſmall matter? Haſt thou thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd thy petty Oaths? thy officious or merry Lies? thy wanton and laſcivious Diſcourſes? Why now make this an ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of thy ſins, that thou haſt thus wretchedly excus'd them. Say, Lord, I have done thus and thus, and ſaid, It was a <hi>little one,</hi> a petty one; as if any ſin were <hi>little</hi> and ſmall, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt <hi>ſo great</hi> a God, ſuch an <hi>infinite</hi> Majeſty. I have ſaid, It is a <hi>little one;</hi> as if any ſin were <hi>little,</hi> which is the <hi>breach</hi> of a moſt holy and juſt, and <hi>good Law.</hi> I have ſaid, It is a <hi>little one;</hi> as if <hi>any ſin</hi> could be accounted <hi>little,</hi> for which the <hi>righteous God</hi> will <hi>certainly</hi> call me to a <hi>ſtrict Account</hi> at the <hi>dreadful</hi> Day of <hi>Judgment.</hi> I have ſaid, It is a <hi>little one;</hi> as if any ſin were <hi>little,</hi> which brings along with it ſo <hi>great a danger;</hi> as if the guilt of the leaſt ſin were not <hi>far greater</hi> than I or any Man can bear, were not enough for ever to ſink me
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:35226:35"/> deep into Hell. I have ſaid, It is a <hi>little one;</hi> as if any ſin were <hi>little,</hi> the guilt whereof can only be done away by the <hi>precious Blood</hi> of Chriſt, the only Son of God. But,</p>
               <p n="5">5. Methinks, there is <hi>one notable</hi> way of Aggravation yet behind, which I have often thought of with my ſelf, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but commend unto you; (I ſhall ſpeak ſomewhat largely to it) it's this: To take up <hi>thoſe very things</hi> with which Men <hi>ordinarily extenuate</hi> their ſins, and with which, it may be, <hi>we our ſelves</hi> have <hi>formerly</hi> extenuated our ſins; and in our Confeſſions, to make <hi>thoſe ſame things</hi> ſerve inſtead of <hi>leſſening</hi> and diminiſhing our ſins, directly to <hi>aggravate</hi> and exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerate them.</p>
               <p>Let's pitch upon thoſe very things with which Men uſually <hi>qualifie</hi> their ſins, and with which, it may be, <hi>we our ſelves</hi> have formerly <hi>qualified,</hi> alleviated, and lightned our ſins; and let's <hi>improve</hi> them, and make uſe of them in our Confeſſions, for the <hi>heightning,</hi> and greatning, and amplifying of our ſins. Let's chuſe out <hi>thoſe very Arguments,</hi> with which Men
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:35226:36"/> commonly <hi>plead</hi> for themſelves, and with which, it may be, <hi>we our ſelves</hi> have ſometimes <hi>pleaded</hi> for our ſelves; and ſo let us <hi>manage</hi> them in our Confeſſions, as that inſtead of making <hi>for us,</hi> they may flatly and plainly make <hi>againſt</hi> us. Do Carnal Men cuſtomarily make the <hi>little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of their ſins, the <hi>commonneſs</hi> of their ſins, their <hi>ignorance</hi> in ſinning, their <hi>temptations</hi> to ſin, their <hi>ſinful Nature,</hi> to be ſo many <hi>Excuſes</hi> of their ſins? And haſt <hi>thou thy ſelf</hi> ſometime taken up, and oft been glad of theſe <hi>Excuſes?</hi> Why now, in thy Confeſſions, <hi>turn theſe Exeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> (I mean thoſe very things which are the Matter of them) into ſo many Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Is't ordinary for Men to make <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> of their ſins, becauſe they are but <hi>little</hi> ones? Nay, haſt <hi>thou thy ſelf</hi> ſaid of thy ſin, as <hi>Lot</hi> did of his <hi>Zoar,</hi> It is a <hi>little</hi> one? Is it not a <hi>little</hi> one? and <hi>thus</hi> extenuated thy ſin? Why rather <hi>ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate</hi> thy ſin, even from hence, in that it was a <hi>little</hi> one: Say, Lord, It was <hi>comparatively</hi> but a <hi>little</hi> one, and yet ſo <hi>unkind</hi> was I to a <hi>kind</hi> God, that I would not do a <hi>ſmall</hi> matter for thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Lord, I
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:35226:36"/> would not ſorbear <hi>this little</hi> ſin, O how loth ſhould I be to forgo and part with a <hi>greater!</hi> You ſee how the <hi>ſmallneſs</hi> and littleneſs of a ſin does ſometimes <hi>greaten</hi> and aggrandize it. Further,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Is the <hi>Commonneſs</hi> of a ſin frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaded for the ſin? And haſt <hi>thou thy ſelf,</hi> at any time, ſaid of thy ſins, they are but <hi>Common ones,</hi> and thought they were <hi>paſſable</hi> for this Excuſe? Why ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>aggravate</hi> thy ſins from the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monneſs</hi> of them: Say, Lord, this ſin of mine was a <hi>common</hi> ſin, which <hi>therefore</hi> I ſhould have <hi>hated</hi> and deteſted, ſhunn'd and avoided; but ſo <hi>vile</hi> and ſinful a wretch was I, that even in <hi>thoſe</hi> things wherein all the <hi>prophane World</hi> riſe up in Arms againſt God, I deſperately joined with them, and <hi>ſided</hi> with thy <hi>Common Enemy</hi> againſt thee. Further yet;</p>
               <p n="3">3. Is't uſual with Men, and has it been ſo with any one of us, to make our <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,</hi> in any degree, a <hi>Cloak</hi> for our ſins, and to think that God would hold us <hi>guiltleſs</hi> becauſe of our <hi>Ignorance?</hi> Why let ſuch an one now confeſs his ſins to be ſo much the <hi>greater,</hi> by how much
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:35226:37" rendition="simple:additions"/> his <hi>Ignorance</hi> was the <hi>groſſer.</hi> And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, ſuch Men as openly or ſecretly <hi>excuſe</hi> their ſins with their Ignorance, are always a great <hi>cauſe</hi> of their own Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; and therefore have good reaſon to aggravate their ſins from their Ignorance in ſinning.

               <p>Yet (which is very obſervable) this humble Confeſſor is not <hi>too too confident</hi> of <hi>himſelf</hi> in his reſolves, but very <hi>fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> jealous, and ſuſpicious of <hi>himſelf</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greatly conſcious to himſelf of his <hi>own Spiritual impotency</hi> and weakneſs, and of the <hi>baſeneſs</hi> and <hi>falſeneſs</hi> of his <hi>own Heart,</hi> which has <hi>formerly deceiv'd</hi> and betrayed him.</p>
               <p>This is very much <hi>Characteriſtical</hi> of a true <hi>hearty</hi> Confeſſor, whereby he is <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferenced</hi> and diſtinguiſhed from a meer Counterfeit and <hi>Hypocritical</hi> Confeſſor: The <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> indeed, in ſome of his <hi>good Moods</hi> and <hi>Fits</hi> (which uſually take him upon ſome ſudden <hi>violent flaſhings</hi> of a <hi>ſtrong Conviction,</hi> or the ſence and <hi>feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of a preſent <hi>Affliction</hi>) will be <hi>forward</hi> to <hi>promiſe</hi> any thing in Confeſſion; will make marvellous <hi>fair proteſtations,</hi> and <hi>ſpecious reſolutions</hi> before God: O, he has done thus and thus, but he'll do ſo no more; no, he'll become a <hi>new Man</hi> out of hand, ay that he will; but all this while
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:35226:65"/> he <hi>confides,</hi> truſts in, and relies on <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> for the performance of all. Thus <hi>raſh</hi> are the <hi>Sick-bed Vows</hi> of moſt Men; O, ſays <hi>one,</hi> that's kept in by a Diſeaſe, and is fain to lie by't; O, ſays he, that God would recover my health and ſtrength again, I'd preſently <hi>turn over a new leaf;</hi> I'd certainly live the <hi>New Life</hi> if God would grant me any: How ſhall all the World ſee, if ever I live to get out of Doors, to go Abroad again, that I'm <hi>quite another Man</hi> than I was! Our Miniſter, all my Neighbors, Friends and Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſhall wonder at the <hi>great change,</hi> and ſtrange alteration that ſhall be found in me: He promiſes amendment of his life by vertue of his <hi>own ſtrength</hi> and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as if his <hi>bare purpoſes</hi> were <hi>Withs,</hi> or <hi>Cords</hi> ſtrong enough to bind the <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> within him; and does not <hi>heartily</hi> deſire <hi>Divine Grace</hi> to aid and back his Reſolutions. And hence it is, that, if God does any thing for ſuch an one, he <hi>preſently forgets himſelf;</hi> forgets all his promiſes which were lately warm upon his Lips; his Luſts revive as his bodily ſtrength renews: He <hi>mends</hi> into his <hi>old ſins</hi> again, and recovers into his former Follies.

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:35226:66"/> putting him to the labour and pains of Practical Mortification, or injoyning him the difficult uſe of a conſtant courſe of neceſſary Means; but he ſo begs the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace, and power and ſtrength, as that he reſolves to <hi>act in the ſtrength</hi> he ſhall receive; and by the help of God, and aſſiſtance of his Grace, to ſtrive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, to reſiſt and deny the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate Temptations; to ſtruggle with, till he maſter and conquer his moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly Luſts, and rebellious Corruptions; and to uſe all Means appointed by God for his Mortification and Sanctification.</p>

               <p>The moſt ſubmiſſive, penitent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, does not at all ſatisfy the Juſtice of God for the wrong we have done him, nor merit a Pardon from him; no, God is infinitely merciful, when he pardons ſin upon Confeſſion.

               <p>Further: The goodneſs of Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, if it were perfectly blameleſs and faultleſs, were yet but a <hi>finite</hi> Good; whereas the Evil of every tranſgreſſion is an <hi>infinite</hi> Evil, becauſe committed againſt an <hi>Infinite</hi> God; but a <hi>finite Good</hi> can't make God recompence and amends for an <hi>infinite Evil.</hi>

                     </gap>.</hi> Penitent Confeſſion of Sin, tho' it do not <hi>merit,</hi> yet it makes <hi>fair way</hi> for forgiveneſs of Sin; It does in the very nature of it make a <hi>Capacity,</hi> and found a Poſſibility of Pardon; It makes the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>vas capax,</hi> a Veſſel <hi>capable,</hi> tho' not <hi>worthy</hi> of any Grace: Whereas the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's obſtinate, wilful hiding, and cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſins, and reſolved continuance in them, does void and deſtroy the very <hi>caſe of Mercy:</hi> Here it is rather <hi>worthy</hi> of God not to forgive, but to puniſh and deſtroy. Such Perſons as won't acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their ſins, are not within the <hi>Limits</hi> and <hi>Poſſibilities</hi> of Pardoning Grace; God <hi>won't,</hi> God <hi>can't</hi> forgive him that won't confeſs. And therefore we find, that when God makes the largeſt promiſes of Mercy to guilty Sinners, he warily inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of Sin as a neceſſary <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> without which his Pardon cannot be afforded. See this clearly in that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table place, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.12, 13. <hi>Return thou backſliding Iſrael,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>and I
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:35226:80"/> will not cauſe mine anger to fall upon you; for I am merciful, ſaith the Lord, and I will not keep anger for ever. Comfortable</hi> and precious <hi>Promiſes</hi> indeed! But <hi>mark,</hi> but <hi>mark</hi> the neceſſary <hi>Condition</hi> of them, in the very next words: <hi>Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou haſt tranſgreſſed against the Lord thy God: Only acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thine iniquity;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, It cannot be elſe; otherwiſe no hope of finding Mercy; I cannot by any means pardon you, unleſs you confeſs.</p>
               <p>It's unbeſeeming, and misbecoming the <hi>Majeſty,</hi> the <hi>Juſtice,</hi> the <hi>Mercy,</hi> the <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> the <hi>Holineſs</hi> of God, for God to pardon and forgive the Sinner, before and without the Confeſſion and Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of his ſin.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It's a thing <hi>not at at all becoming the Majeſty of God.</hi> God has already <hi>yielded</hi> as far as he can, with ſafety to his <hi>Honor,</hi> in condeſcending to ſuch low Terms, and fair Propoſals as this is, of giving our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don upon our Confeſſion: He can't ſtoop any lower, without doing prejudice to himſelf, and being injurious to his own Honor and Greatneſs. God is <hi>good,</hi> but
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:35226:81"/> yet ſo as that he's <hi>great</hi> too; now his Greatneſs and Majeſty (which he is bound to maintain, unleſs he could deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; I ſay, his Greatneſs and Majeſty) requ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>res the ſinful Creatures humble ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of himſelf, and acknowledgment of his ſin, before his Mercy can do him any good, or ſhew him any favour. Does it beſeem God to pardon ſuch an one as denies his Soveraign Right, Power, and Authority over him? Why, Confeſſion of our Sins to God, is but our due acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of a Superior; and what leſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment can we make of God's Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to us, and Dominion over us, than when we have broken the Laws, violated the Commands of this our Lord and King, as we hope for Mercy, not to juſtifie our illegal Actions, but to confeſs that we have done what we ought not to have done: Leſs than this, pray, what is it but a plain diſowning of God, a refuſing to have him to rule and reign over us, a renouncing of all homage and ſubjection due unto him? God can't, in point of <hi>Honor,</hi> pardon ſuch an obſtinate Sinner, as won't make the leaſt acknowledgment of his ſin. In <hi>civil affairs</hi> among Men, he's never judged fit to be admitted into
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:35226:81"/> favor, who ſtands in, and will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his fault; and ſhall we think that <hi>God</hi> has not good reaſon to take as much upon him as his <hi>Creature?</hi> Shall we allow a poor ſimple creature to ſtand ſo much upon't? And would we have the great God put up any thing any how? Surely God reſpects and regards himſelf more than ſo. It's a thing <hi>unbeſeeming</hi> the <hi>Majeſty</hi> of God, for God to pardon ſin without the Sinner's Confeſſion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It's a thing <hi>not at all beſeeming and befitting the Juſtice of God,</hi> for God to pardon Sin without demanding any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
               <p>If God ſhould pardon wilful, ſtubborn, impenitent Sinners, that won't confeſs, but reſolvedly retain and hold faſt their ſins, how could his <hi>Juſtice</hi> bear it? It's true, Confeſſion does not <hi>ſatisfie</hi> God's <hi>Juſtice,</hi> yet ſins unconfeſs'd can't be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd without <hi>Injuſtice;</hi> for tho' Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Sin does not <hi>ſatisfie,</hi> yet does it greatly <hi>glorifie</hi> God's <hi>Juſtice;</hi> and God will never ſhew himſelf <hi>Gracious</hi> in any ſuch way wherein he ſhall loſe the glory of his <hi>Juſtice;</hi> no, God conſults the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> of every Attribute, and won't exerciſe
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:35226:82"/> one Attribute to the damage and detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of another. God's <hi>Juſtice</hi> won't ſuffer him to pardon but upon Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; therefore Confeſſion is neceſſary.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It's <hi>unbeſeeming the Mercy of God,</hi> to give a Pardon, where there's no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; for Mercy will never be taken for Mercy, if Sin be not acknowledged to be Sin. He that won't confeſs his ſins, will never acknowledge his need of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; will never magnifie Divine Grace; will never deſire it, or ſeek after it; will never account himſelf really behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God for it: When we heartily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge our offences, and our ſins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in our ſence and feeling, then Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don is moſt precious, Grace is moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. God's Mercy won't give out a Pardon but upon Confeſſion; for certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, God's Mercy would not be enough eſteem'd and valued, were not our own Sin and Miſery firſt own'd by us and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Laſtly: It's <hi>unbeſeeming the Wiſdom and the Holineſs of God,</hi> for God to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don Sin, without requiring the Sinner's Confeſſion; for this would be to give
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:35226:82"/> countenance and <hi>encouragement to Sin;</hi> this would be to open a Flood-gate to all Impiety and Profaneneſs, this would be a plain Confirmation of the Sinner in his ſin, and a ready way and means of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him grow every day worſe and worſe: It would be much like, as if a <hi>Phyſician</hi> ſhould preſcribe a <hi>Cordial</hi> to one that has a very <hi>foul Stomach,</hi> before he had taken a <hi>Vomit;</hi> which would be ſo far from <hi>reſtoring</hi> and recovering the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,</hi> that it would <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> and fortify the <hi>humor,</hi> and ſo increaſe, and heighten, and <hi>nouriſh</hi> the <hi>Diſeaſe. Confeſſio Vomitus:</hi> Confeſſion is ordinarily compared to a <hi>Vomit;</hi> now if God ſhould give in a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> which is as a ſtrong <hi>Cordial,</hi> to a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner before the <hi>filth</hi> were fetch'd up, and caſt out of his Soul, by a free and full Confeſſion of his Sins, this would but <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearten</hi> him to ſin more <hi>preſumptuouſly,</hi> and animate him to go on more confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his wickedneſs; it would but make him multiply to Sin, as God multiplied to Pardon; ſo far would it be from ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and interrupting the courſe of his ſin, and breaking him of from it. Now this does not at all conſiſt with God's <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> nor with his <hi>Holineſs,</hi> to do that which
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:35226:83"/> would give the greateſt encouragement to ſin, and be a direct means of making the Sinner to grow worſe and worſe.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee, it's neither agreeing with the <hi>Majeſty,</hi> nor with the <hi>Juſtice,</hi> nor with the <hi>Mercy,</hi> nor with the <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> nor with the <hi>Sanctity</hi> of God, to remit and pardon Sin, before and without Confeſſion. And that is the fourth Reaſon: Confeſſion of Sin is <hi>indiſpenſably neceſſay</hi> to <hi>remiſſion</hi> of Sins ſo as that <hi>God can't well Pardon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</hi>

                  <hi>Mortification.</hi> It's a <hi>voluntary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting,</hi> revoking, undoing, as far as in us lies, what formerly we have done; and a hopeful <hi>prevention of</hi> the future commiſſion of our ſin. As often as we confeſs, we give ſin, as it were, a <hi>new blow:</hi> In every true Confeſſion, we renew our ſence of the Evil and Danger that is in ſin, and ſtrengthen our reſolution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our ſins, and faſten an Obligation upon our ſelves to leave and forſake our ſins; ſo that we cannot now ſin again ſo <hi>freely</hi> and eaſily as before. Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:35226:83"/> of our Sins does, in the very nature of it, ſolemnly <hi>engage</hi> us againſt ſin, and lay a ſtrong <hi>tye</hi> upon us to the contrary; it's apt, by way of <hi>Motive,</hi> and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to hinder and reſtrain us from ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, after we have confeſſed; it's a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect means of making ſin more <hi>uneaſie</hi> and <hi>unpleaſant</hi> to us for the future; and ſo becomes a fit and proper Inſtrument of beating us off from our ſins, and making us wholly to depart from them.</p>
               <p>Thus Confeſſion is an Act of <hi>Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> and therefore there's good reaſon we ſhould confeſs. That's the fifth ground of Confeſſion.</p>
               <p n="6">6 <hi>Reaſ.</hi> We muſt confeſs, becauſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion teſtifies unto God, and evidences unto our ſelves the <hi>ſincerity</hi> and unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of our <hi>Repentance,</hi> and gives us good aſſurance that we are in a fair way of <hi>Recovery.</hi> It teſtifies unto God, and evidences to our ſelves the <hi>Sincerity</hi> of our <hi>Repentance.</hi> 'Tis a plain Token that the Man bears a ſtrong Affection to his ſin, and it's ſweet and pleaſurable to him, when he hideth it under his Tongue, and ſpareth it, as <hi>Zophar</hi> ſpeaketh: (<hi>Job</hi> 20.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:35226:84"/> 12, 13.) But it's a good Sign that a Man is out of love with his ſin, when he's ready to diſcover it, and diſpoſed hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to confeſs it. The Sick Man, that will not truly declare to his <hi>Phyſician</hi> what the Meat or Drink was that proved prejudicial to his Health, and cauſed his <hi>Diſtemper,</hi> has no intention to forbear and abſtain from it; and that's the very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why he ſeeks to conceal it. So 'tis here: When a Sinner is not free to diſcloſe and confeſs his ſin to God, it is becauſe he has no <hi>ſincere</hi> purpoſe to leave and forſake it; no <hi>honeſt deſire,</hi> by the Grace and Help of God, to be kept and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from it for the future. A fly reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſin, is an Argument of the <hi>deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs</hi> of the Heart; but full Confeſſion, is a proof and demonſtration that there is no Guile in a Man's Spirit, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.2.</p>
               <p>And becauſe Confeſſion witneſſes to a Man's ſelf the <hi>Sincerity</hi> of his <hi>Repentance,</hi> therefore it muſt needs give the Sinner good aſſurance, that he is in a fair way of <hi>Recovery,</hi> out of ſin and danger. And, indeed, a Man may ſafely conclude thus: I find I can ſincerely confeſs my ſin to God, therefore I hope I limit now be rid
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:35226:84"/> of it; for it's a certain Sign, that the ill Quality is removing, and the Diſeaſe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off, when once it breaks out at the Lips; and as in the Diſeaſe we common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call the <hi>Small-Pox</hi> the greateſt fear is, either in their not appearing, or in their preſent ſtriking in again; but there's very good Hope of Life and Health, if they break out <hi>kindly.</hi> So here: The Sinner has juſt cauſe to fear Death, when his ſins lie inward, and ſtrike to his <hi>Heart;</hi> but if they come forth thick, and be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out abundantly in a free Confeſſion, he has then good reaſon to be of good chear, and may well entertain ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable hopes of being freed from Sin and Death, of enjoying his Soul's Health, and obtaining Eternal Life.</p>
               <p n="7">7 <hi>Reaſ.</hi> We ſhould confeſs, and lay open our ſins to God, becauſe Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <hi>eaſes</hi> our troubled Spirits, and <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burdens</hi> our <hi>oppreſſed Conſciences.</hi> You know, the opening of a Vein cools the Blood; when our Hearts are full with the ſence of our ſins, that they cannot hold and contain themſelves, then is it neceſſary to give a vent to our Hearts by confeſſing our ſins. This is a moſt <hi>ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:35226:85"/> way to receive <hi>Comfort</hi> in; Griefs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed are beſt eaſed and mitigated: All <hi>Paſſions</hi> are allayed by <hi>vent</hi> and utterance. This is true, however the Devil, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Lyes ſuggeſts to us, that in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we ſhall bring our ſelves to Deſpair; that we ſhall run out of our Wits, and even kill and deſtroy our ſelves, and never live a Merry Day again, if we offer to think of our old Sins, and go about to rank them particularly, and ſet them in order before God, by a full, and faithful, and frequent Confeſſion. Let's but try, and we ſhall ſoon experimentally find as great Relief and Remedy to our uneaſie and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted Conſciences, our troubled and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened Souls, by confeſſing our ſins aright to God, as ever any ſick and oppreſſed Stomach did, by throwing up the Food that offended and diſagreed with it; or Part that was Impoſthumated, by letting out the Corruption that pained and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented it.</p>
               <p n="8">8 <hi>Reaſ.</hi> We muſt confeſs our ſins, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it were <hi>unreaſonable Folly</hi> in us, to go about to <hi>hide</hi> any ſins <hi>from God;</hi> and the <hi>wiſeſt</hi> way to <hi>conceal</hi> them <hi>from others,</hi> is to <hi>diſcover</hi> them <hi>to God,</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:35226:85"/>
               <p>There are two branches of this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:</p>
               <p n="1">1. We ſhould confeſs, becauſe it were unreaſonable <hi>Folly</hi> in us to go about to <hi>hide</hi> any ſins from God. We may be the better for confeſſing, but we cannot be the worſe for confeſſing; our ſins won't be e'er the more known and divulged for our confeſſing of them to an <hi>Omniſcient</hi> God. St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> (in his comment on the Parable of the <hi>Prodigal</hi> Son in the 15th of St. <hi>Luke;</hi> ſpeaking of thoſe words of the Prodigal, <hi>I will ariſe, and go to my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and will ſay unto him, Father, I have ſinned,</hi> &amp;c.) ſpeaks excellently to the matter in hand, and deſcribes the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and folly of not confeſſing, but co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering and concealing our ſins from God: <hi>In vain,</hi> ſays he, <hi>wouldſt thou hide any thing from him, whom thou canſt deceive in nothing, and thou may'ſt reveal without danger what thou art ſure is known alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi> Surely the <hi>Malefactor</hi> would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal any thing from the <hi>Judge,</hi> if he were certain the <hi>Judge</hi> knew all before-hand. Let every one conſider, that God has a darting and piercing Eye that ſees the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:35226:86"/> very bottom of our Souls: God ſees not as Man ſees; he ſees and judges the very Heart. <hi>O God, thou knoweſt my fooliſhneſs, and my ſins are not hid from thee,</hi> ſays <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> Pſal. 69.5. <hi>He ſearches and tries the very reins,</hi> Jer. 11.20.</p>
               <p>Alas <hi>fond</hi> Sinner! God is intimately acquainted with thee, and with thy ways; he knows thee better than thou doeſt thy ſelf: Doeſt think to hide any thing from him? Why, cannot he that made all the Chambers of thy Heart for his own uſe, unlock every Door, and enter into every Room of it, and ſearch what is in every corner of it, without thy help or <hi>leave?</hi> Know and underſtand, God is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in thee, and with thee: Thou art never ſo much <hi>alone,</hi> but that thou art ſtill in <hi>company</hi> with God; never ſo much in ſecret, but that all thou doeſt is<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.13.</note> naked, and open, and manifeſt unto the Eyes of the great God that fills Heaven and Earth: He was preſent with thee, even then when thou thoughteſt none was near thee; when no Eye of Man ſaw thee, he ſaw thy wickedneſs, he was a Spectator of thy ſin: If thou ſayeſt, ſurely the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall cover me, <hi>even the night ſhall be light about thee; yea, the darkneſs hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:35226:86"/> not from him, but the night ſhineth as the day; the darkneſs and the light are both alike to him;</hi> as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.11, 12.</p>
               <p>Hence it is that Devout <hi>Auſtin</hi> cries out in the 10th Book of his Confeſſions, the 2d Chapter: <hi>Lord, what of me would be hid from thee, if I would not confeſs to thee, unto whoſe Eyes the great Ahyſs, and depth of Man's Conſcience, is naked and apparent? I might, indeed, hide God from my ſelf,</hi> ſays he, <hi>my ſelf from God I could not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the firſt branch of the 8th Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: God can take no Advantage againſt us by our Confeſſions, for we tell him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing he knew not before; it is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing the <hi>Judge</hi> againſt our ſelves; God himſelf was an <hi>Eye-witneſs</hi> of all we ever did, and therefore it is <hi>groſs Folly</hi> to go about to conceal any thing from God. But further:</p>
               <p n="2">2. As it's <hi>Folly</hi> to think to <hi>hide</hi> any one ſin <hi>from God,</hi> ſo the <hi>wiſeſt</hi> way to <hi>conceal</hi> all <hi>hidden</hi> ſins <hi>from others,</hi> is to lay them <hi>open to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:35226:87"/>
               <p>A free acknowledgment of ſin to God, is the beſt courſe can be taken to <hi>maintain the ſecreſie of the Soul;</hi> the only way to have one's <hi>ſecret</hi> ſins <hi>cover'd,</hi> is to <hi>diſcover</hi> them by Confeſſion, that ſo they may not be brought upon the Stage before all the World. If we <hi>confeſs</hi> our ſins, God will <hi>conceal</hi> them; if we take <hi>ſhame</hi> to our ſelves, God will keep us from ſhame and diſhonor; but if we <hi>hide</hi> them. God will <hi>uncover</hi> them; perhaps here in this World, by making others to publiſh and bring them to light; or cauſing thee thy ſelf to betray thy ſelf, in ſome ſickneſs of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or trouble of Mind and Conſcience; or, it may be, he may make thee the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of turning thine own <hi>inſide out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> and declaring the privy paſſages of thy <hi>Life,</hi> when thou lieſt upon thy <hi>Death-Bed:</hi> But if he bring not thy hidden works of <hi>darkneſs</hi> to <hi>light</hi> here, he will, to be ſure, reveal them hereafter, at the Day of Judgment, before all the Saints and Angels of heaven, to thy eternal Diſgrace and Reproach. In vain, in vain doeſt thou bury them here in ſilence, for God will find a time to rake them up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; and there ſhall certainly be, to all
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:35226:87"/> wicked impenitent Sinners, a <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of their <hi>Sins</hi> as well as their <hi>Perſons;</hi> it is our <hi>ſafeſt</hi> courſe then voluntarily to confeſs, for God will, ſome time or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. ſet <hi>wide open</hi> the Cloſets of our Hearts, if we <hi>lock them up</hi> our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="9">9 <hi>Reaſ.</hi> We muſt confeſs our ſins, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it's not only a <hi>fooliſh,</hi> but an <hi>unſafe and hazardous, a deſperate and dangerous thing, for any to attempt to hide and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal their ſins from God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God ſeverely threatens this unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to confeſs; <hi>He that covereth his ſins ſhall not proſper,</hi> ſays God by <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 28.13. What, ſhall he not proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per? Yes, proſper in his wickedneſs, and go on in his ſins he ſhall; but believe it, that's but <hi>ill thriving:</hi> But he ſhall not proſper; that is, he ſhall not go <hi>Scot-free,</hi> he ſhall not eſcape Divine Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, he ſhall be plagued with many <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedial Judgments</hi> here; and (if they do no good on him) he ſhall be puniſh'd with <hi>eternal Damnation</hi> hereafter.</p>
               <p>We plainly find, that they that have hid their ſins, have fared much the worſe for it. A famous inſtance of this we have in <hi>David,</hi> who, when he had murder'd
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:35226:88"/> 
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> ſo cloſely and cunningly, could hardly be brought to confeſs his ſin ſo much as ſecretly to God himſelf, as if he had ſubtilly deceiv'd <hi>God,</hi> as well as <hi>Man:</hi> He finely puts it off and excuſes it; he makes it to be nothing but the <hi>Chance</hi> of War; the <hi>Sword,</hi> ſays he, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth one as well as another,</hi> 2 Sam. 11.25. Now, even <hi>David</hi> himſelf, tho' he was a very <hi>dear Child</hi> of God, very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in his eyes; tho' God was very <hi>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> of him, yet in ſuch a caſe as this he would not ſpare him; no, <hi>David</hi> himſelf muſt <hi>ſmart</hi> for it and be ſenſible of the Divine diſpleaſure; God puts him upon the <hi>Rack,</hi> torments, and tortures him, till he had made him confeſs. Take the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his affliction from himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.3, 4. <hi>My bones,</hi> ſays he, <hi>waxed old thro' my roaring all the day long; for day and night thy hand was heavy upon me; my moiſture is turned into the drought of ſummer;</hi> and he himſelf renders the very reaſon of this to be his want of Confeſſion and Humiliation, at the beginning of the third Verſe, <hi>When I kept ſilence my bones waxed old; when I kept ſilence:</hi> A free Confeſſion would have ſav'd and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented all; it was his guileful, deceitful
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:35226:88"/> Dealing with God, which brought all this evil on him, which coſt him ſo dear, and was the true cauſe of all his Trouble: It was his <hi>holding his peace</hi> that made him <hi>cry out;</hi> 'twas his keeping <hi>Silence</hi> that made him <hi>roar.</hi> Sin wilfully kept in by any Man, draws <hi>ſorrow</hi> and puniſhment upon the Man, and holds them there ſo long as it ſelf is retain'd; but <hi>free-heartedneſs</hi> in Confeſſion does hinder God's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from ſeizing on the Penitent Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or ſuddenly removes whatever Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have fallen upon him.</p>

               <p>You read in the Parable of the <hi>Prodigal</hi> Son, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. and the latter end, how his <hi>Elder Brother</hi> objected againſt him to his <hi>Father,</hi> his baſe and unworthy car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages towards his Father, his leaving his Father's Houſe and Family, his devouring his living with Harlots, and waſting h s ſubſtance with riotous living: But all this, tho' true, nothing alter'd or aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his <hi>Father;</hi> and why? Becauſe the Elder Brother came <hi>too late,</hi> the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal had got the ſpeed of him, had fore-accus'd himſelf, and already obtain'd his Pardon. <hi>Satan,</hi> our Elder Brother by Creation, will certainly prove our mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Accuſer; but if we timely prevent him by pre-condemning our ſelves to God our Father, we ſhall undoubtedly <hi>get an Act of Indemnity before he can enter his Action againſt us.</hi> God won't hear a word ſpoken againſt us from <hi>him,</hi> if he has <hi>firſt</hi> heard <hi>us</hi> ſpeak againſt our ſelves to himſelf.

               <p>When Men lie upon their <hi>Death-Bed,</hi> and are going out of the World, then the <hi>roaring Lion</hi> goeth about ſeeking how he may devour them; then is our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the <hi>Devil,</hi> moſt active, ſtirring, and <hi>buſie;</hi> then does the ſubtile Head of this wily Serpent work moſt ſtrongly; then does he inject, and caſt into the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a Sinner, whatever terrors, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frightments, and diſcouragements he can; then does he, what in him lies, tempt the Sinner to <hi>final Deſpair,</hi> by ſetting his ſins in order before him, and telling him, ſuch and ſuch a heinous ſin didſt thou commit at ſuch and ſuch a time; thus much guilt lies upon thee, therefore thou art <hi>Damn'd:</hi> Alas, it's <hi>too late</hi> to confeſs

               <p>Whereas the truly humble Penitent, who has fully done the Devil's Work for him; who has not only been <hi>Spontaneus Satan,</hi> a <hi>Satan to himſelf,</hi> as Satan is a ſubtile <hi>Tempter,</hi> and ſo ſometimes tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſeduced himſelf; but has likewiſe been <hi>Spontaneus Satan,</hi> a kind of <hi>Satan to himſelf,</hi> as Satan is an <hi>Adverſary</hi> and <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer;</hi> and ſo has often accuſed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:35226:91"/> himſelf in a free and full Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all his ſins. <hi>This Man</hi> placed upon his <hi>Death-Bed,</hi> is either undiſturb'd by Satan, or able to conteſt with him: Let <hi>Satan</hi> truly object never ſo many ſins to him, he grants all; and is bold to tell the <hi>Devil,</hi> That he won't deſpair in hearing that from <hi>him,</hi> which he has <hi>himſelf</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd, in Faith, to God. It's true, Satan, ſays he, I have done thus and thus; and I have, with ſhame, acknowledged as much, and more to God: I therefore fear not thy Charge, becauſe I <hi>firſt</hi> charg'd my ſelf, and ſo truſt I'm diſcharg'd by God: In vain doeſt thou accuſe and condemn me to my ſelf, who have already accus'd and condemn'd my ſelf to my God, and therefore hope I'm acquitted and abſolv'd by him.</p>
               <p>When the Adverſary is thus non-plus'd and ſilenc'd, when Satan's Mouth is thus ſtopp'd and ſhut, that he has nothing to ſay to the Penitent Sinner; when neither his own Conſcience, nor the Devil accuſe him, then God ſays to him, as once Chriſt ſaid to the Woman charg'd with Adultery, when her Accuſers left her, <hi>John</hi> 8.11. <hi>Where are thine Accuſers? has no one condemn'd thee? neither do I
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:35226:91"/> condemn thee.</hi> And adds further; not, <hi>Go and ſin no more;</hi> but, <hi>Go where thou ſhalt ſin no more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. And this leads me to the ſecond branch of this laſt Reaſon: <hi>Confeſſion of Sin, or Self-Judging, ſurely foreſtals the juſt Sentence and Judgment of the great Judge an the laſt Day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By Judging our ſelves, we do (as I may ſay) God's Work and Office for him, and ſo ſave him a labour; neither are we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly and injurious to God, by thus taking, as it were, his Work out of his hands; this is no bold <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation</hi> on our part, but his own free and voluntary <hi>Conceſſion,</hi> for <hi>Judgment</hi> is his <hi>ſtrange Work,</hi> his <hi>ſtrange Act,</hi> Iſa. 28.21. and he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a great deal have it done <hi>by us upon our ſelves,</hi> than <hi>done upon us by himſelf:</hi> He's very well pleas'd with our own do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it; inſomuch, that <hi>if we would judge our ſelves, we ſhould not be judged,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.31.</p>
               <p>And this is the laſt Reaſon of the Duty of Confeſſion, taken from the unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able happineſs, the ſweet peace, and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:35226:92"/> Paradiſe</hi> of ſuch a Man, who hath no ſin unconfeſs'd when he comes to die; whereas he that won't accuſe himſelf now, gives no ſmall advantage to Satan's Accuſations of him to God; and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of him, eſpecially upon his <hi>Death-Bed:</hi> And he that can't be brought to Judge himſelf now, he does but Reprieve himſelf a while, and defer the Sentence till the <hi>Grand Aſſizes,</hi> where he ſhall be ſure to be Accus'd, Condemn'd, and Executed.</p>

               <p>I Have fully open'd the <hi>Nature</hi> of this Duty to you, and have confirm'd it by many ſtrong and weighty <hi>Reaſons</hi> and Arguments; I ſhall now endeavour to apply it, and make uſe of it.</p>
               <p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. By way of Confutation. <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Commentators</hi> do ſtrain this <hi>Text</hi> to favour <hi>Auricular</hi> Confeſſion, without any colour, ſhew or ſhadow of Reaſon for ſo doing: For it plainly and naturally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects Confeſſion of Sin made to God, and not in the Ears of a Prieſt. Our Church indeed adviſes in her ſeaſonable and excellent Exhortation before the Communion, That if any Perſon's Mind be troubled and uneaſie, and his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence burden'd and unſatisfied, and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find eaſe and relief, and <hi>quiet his own
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:35226:93"/> Conſcience</hi> by any means uſed by himſelf, <hi>but requireth further Comfort or Counſel; he ſhould go to his own, or to ſome other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet and learned Miniſter of God's Word, and open his Grief, that by the Miniſtry of God's Holy Word he may receive the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of Abſolution, together with Ghoſtly Counſel and Advice, to the quieting of his Conſcience, and avoiding of all Scruple and Doubtfulneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> binds all Men in Conſcience, by a Law made, to make a particular, ſpecial Confeſſion to a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> of all their <hi>mortal</hi> Sins committed after <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> ev'n of their moſt <hi>ſecret</hi> and hidden Sins, with all <hi>Circumſtances</hi> that change the kind, and alter the nature of the Sin, as far as poſſibly they can call, and bring them to remembrance, upon due Premeditation, and a diligent Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of themſelves. And, once every Year at the leaſt, to confeſs to a <hi>Priest</hi> (unleſs it be in the caſe of <hi>extream neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity</hi>) all ſuch Sins, and heightning Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, which they have been guilty of ſince they were laſt ſhriven. They call for the particularizing of Sins, and the explication and manifeſtation of all aggravating Circumſtances, that the <hi>Prieſt</hi>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:35226:93"/> (as they pretend) may judge of the <hi>weight</hi> and <hi>merit</hi> of every Fault, and know how to impoſe a <hi>condign Penance,</hi> and to enjoyn a convenient and corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent <hi>Satisfaction.</hi> Tho' the Truth is, the <hi>Prieſts</hi> have no Authority to impoſe what <hi>Penances</hi> they ſhall think fit: Nor have they Ability, preſently and on a ſudden, to weigh Things ſo exactly and evenly, as to order and appoint Penances juſt and equal, anſwerable and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to the Sins confeſs'd. And it is apparent, and well known, how <hi>ſlight</hi> and triſling and ridiculous the <hi>Confeſſors</hi> often are in the <hi>Penances</hi> they enjoin for Sins of a very <hi>high nature.</hi> And all their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Satisfactions, tho' intended only for the Temporal Puniſhment due to Sin in Purgatory, are highly injurious to the full and perfect Satisfaction of Chriſt. This Confeſſion of Sins to the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> is that which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſpeak ſo much of in all their <hi>Catechiſms,</hi> tho' God ſays not one word of it in all the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> St. <hi>James</hi> indeed bids us <hi>confeſs our faults one to another, (James</hi> 5.16.) But this is <hi>reciprocal,</hi> and obliges as well the Prieſt to make Confeſſion to us, as <hi>any of us</hi> to do it to the <hi>Prieſt.</hi> And when it is
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:35226:94"/> ſaid, that a great number were baptized, <hi>confeſſing their ſins, (Matt.</hi> 3.6.) And that <hi>many that believed came and confeſſed, and ſhewed their deeds; (Acts</hi> 19.18.) Their Confeſſion <hi>then</hi> was <hi>voluntary</hi> and unconſtrained; and was made in <hi>general,</hi> and ſurely not <hi>very particularly,</hi> as to Sins and Circumſtances, by ſo many Perſons, as flocked together upon thoſe occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Auricular Confeſſion,</hi> as it is now practiſed, is a <hi>human invention,</hi> and was firſt inacted and inſtituted by the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Lateran</hi> under <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third, twelve hundred Years after Chriſt. God in his Word does not command it; yet they require it under the Penalty of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> and make the neglect thereof <hi>mortal.</hi> They make it abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely <hi>neceſſary</hi> to the procuring and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Pardon and Forgiveneſs. They place much <hi>Merit</hi> and Sanctity in it. And attribute a <hi>Judicial Authority</hi> to the <hi>Priest</hi> to forgive Sins, which is a Power <hi>peculiar</hi> to God himſelf. And affirm, that <hi>Attrition</hi> only, or, a ſlight Sorrow for fear of Hell, ſufficiently qualifies for <hi>Abſolution.</hi> And the <hi>cuſtomary Practiſe</hi> of abſolving all that confeſs, tho' guilty of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:35226:94"/> frequent <hi>Relapſes,</hi> without any probable, <hi>hopeful Signs</hi> of a <hi>real Change</hi> in 'em, does invite and encourage habitual Sinners to put their truſt, and to <hi>reſt</hi> in the <hi>Prieſt's Abſolution,</hi> without hearty Repentance, and Sincere purpoſes of Reformation. They make <hi>Confeſſion</hi> to a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> one of the three <hi>eſſential</hi> Parts of Repentance, tho' it be no Part, nor Argument of true Repentance. A very Hypocrite may make Auricular Confeſſion to a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> as <hi>Saul</hi> did to <hi>Samnel,</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.24, 30.) But he cannot find in his Heart to go and humble himſelf to God, in confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his Sins to him with a broken and <hi>contrite Heart.</hi> They do not reckon the <hi>hearty Confeſſion</hi> of our daily Sins to God <hi>ſufficient</hi> and available for our <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> Nor do they preſs it as a Matter of ſo great Neceſſity, or Utility, as the <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of Sins to a <hi>Prieſt</hi> is. They account it a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> tho' it want <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtitution,</hi> and have not the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Parts</hi> of a <hi>Sacrament.</hi> There is <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing given to Man</hi> in their <hi>Sacrament</hi> of <hi>Penance,</hi> which can have the <hi>uſe</hi> of an <hi>external Sign,</hi> and ſerve to repreſent any <hi>Spiritual</hi> Thing. How <hi>abſurd</hi> is it here, to put the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Penitent,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:35226:95"/> and Operation of the Receiver, for, as it were, the <hi>Matter,</hi> and a <hi>Part</hi> of the <hi>Sacrament!</hi> They make <hi>Confeſſion</hi> to a <hi>Prieſt neceſſary</hi> to <hi>Salvation,</hi> when it is not neceſſary <hi>to any good End and Purpoſe,</hi> nor <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>convenient</hi> to be uſed at all. For, the Injunction of it is the Exerciſe of a <hi>Spiritual Tyranny;</hi> and proves, in the effect of it, a <hi>Torturing</hi> of the Minds, and a <hi>Racking</hi> of the <hi>Conſciences</hi> of Men. It gives <hi>Occaſion</hi> of many indecent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly, filthy and <hi>immodeſt Queſtions</hi> and <hi>Anſwers</hi> in the Confeſſion of ſome Sins. And is an <hi>Artifice</hi> and Contrivance inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and excogitated to diſcover <hi>Secrets,</hi> to keep the People in Fear and Awe, to get Gain and Profit, and inrich that <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous</hi> and <hi>ambitious</hi> See with great and large Revenues.</p>

               <p n="1">

               </p>
               <p>I have thought upon ſomewhat which may ſerve to direct you (1.) before the Duty, in your <hi>Preparation</hi> to it. (2.) Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſome <hi>Circumſtances</hi> of the very <hi>Peformance</hi> of it. (3.) And laſtly, In your carriage and behaviour after the Duty.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Before Confeſſion, take theſe two <hi>Preparatory Directions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Premeditate</hi> as much as you can in order to Confeſſion.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:35226:110"/>2. Be ſure to <hi>look up unto God</hi> for <hi>Con-Conviction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Meditate</hi> before you confeſs.</p>
               <p>Much is the fruit, great is the <hi>benefit</hi> of this <hi>Direction,</hi> I ſhall ſhew you a fourfold Benefit of it</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Previous Meditation works the heart into a ſolemn, ſerious, confeſſing frame and temper.</hi> Confeſſion, it's the pouring out of the Heart before God; now previous <hi>Meditation</hi> even melts the Sinner's Heart, fits and prepares it to be poured out. Alas! our Stomach at firſt is too big to confeſs our ſin, to acknowledge our ſelves in a fault; for this is an act of Humility, of yielding and ſubmitting to another, which we naturally ſcorn to do, and won't be brought to, till our Heart be broken, till our Stomach be pull'd down; which is kindly wrought, effectually done by <hi>Meditation:</hi> by conſidering the <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty</hi> of God over us; his <hi>Power</hi> to make a Law, and to command us the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of it; by bethinking our ſelves, how much to our own <hi>Advantage</hi> the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:35226:111"/> keeping of this Law would have been both here and hereafter; and yet that we have <hi>wilfully</hi> broken this holy, and juſt, and good Law, and ſo made our ſelves <hi>obnoxious</hi> to Divine Juſtice: Conſidering after all this, that it <hi>is not in vain</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs what we have done, our Heart can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be now ready, our Mouth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be open, to confeſs the extream ſinfulneſs of our ſins. Thus you ſee how <hi>Premeditation</hi> puts us upon Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and makes us willingly buckle to the Duty, by ſhewing us the <hi>Reaſonableneſs</hi> and <hi>Profitableneſs</hi> of the performance of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Meditation;</hi> as it puts the Sinner upon Confeſſion, ſo it <hi>affords and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters abundant Mat er for Confeſſion.</hi> He that meditates before he confeſſes, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well furniſhed in his Confeſſion: He is not at a ſtand, he is not to ſeek for what he ſhould confeſs next; he ſees e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in himſelf, to complain of himſelf for unto God. It's this <hi>Mediation</hi> that fills up the Bill of Indictment with ſo many <hi>Items. Meditation;</hi> it fully and clearly diſcovers our ſins to us: It's the bringing the <hi>Elephant</hi> to the Water, and the ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:35226:111"/> of him there the uglineſs and deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his<note n="*" place="margin">Lerg Scout.</note> 
                  <hi>Proboſcis.</hi> The <hi>Water</hi> is the <hi>Law;</hi> now by <hi>Meditation,</hi> we compare our ſelves with the Law of God, and our Practiſes with its Commands and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions; and ſo we ſee how hugely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient how very far ſhort we are of our ſeveral Duties. <hi>Meditation</hi> is the <hi>Hand</hi> which holds the <hi>Glaſs</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> before us, in which we plainly behold our own <hi>Faces,</hi> and ſee all the <hi>ſpots</hi> and blemiſhes we have contracted. <hi>Meditation</hi> is the <hi>perambulation</hi> of the Mind thro' the whole courſe of a Man's old Life: It's a <hi>reflection</hi> upon, a recollection and recognition of our former actions. When we have by ſolemn <hi>Meditation</hi> read over the Book of our paſt life, turn'd over and examin'd the ſeveral leafs of it, and ſo made good obſervation of our former Converſation, then ſhall we be beſt able, in our Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to ſet down juſtly our <hi>Errata's,</hi> and to give our God a penitential relation of our miſcarriages.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Meditation,</hi> as it brings in <hi>Matter,</hi> ſo it begets <hi>Affection.</hi>

               <p>I Shall, in the ſecond place, direct you concerning ſome <hi>Circumſtances</hi> of the very performance of this Duty: And firſt,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:35226:113"/> Concerning the <hi>Time</hi> when. (2.) Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Place</hi> where we ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Concerning the <hi>Time</hi> and Seaſon of Confeſſion, take theſe Directions:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Confeſs <hi>continually:</hi> As the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſays,<note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.17.</note> 
                  <hi>Pray without ceaſing.</hi> So ſay I, <hi>Confeſs without ceaſing:</hi> Be <hi>always</hi> in a confeſſing <hi>frame</hi> and temper: Frequently ſend up <hi>Ejaculatory</hi> Confeſſions to the Throne of Grace: <hi>Continually</hi> walk <hi>humbly</hi> with thy God, under a deep ſence of thy own vileneſs, ſinfulneſs, and unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Confeſs <hi>daily.</hi> This is a Debt, that every day grows due to God. Thou art a daily Sinner, and if every day thou findeſt time to ſin, O be ſure you ſpare time to confeſs your ſin. We daily add ſin unto ſin, and therefore let's daily add ſorrow to ſorrow; and renew our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, as we renew our Tranſgreſſion. Let's pitch upon ſome ſet and <hi>ſtated Times</hi> for the daily ſolemn ſiſting of our ſelves before God, and the making a faithful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of our ſins to him. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:35226:114"/> the Law, there was appointed both <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.39.</note> a <hi>Morning</hi> and an <hi>Evening</hi>-Sacrifice every Day; of which the <hi>Hebrew Doctors</hi> ſay, The continual Sacrifice of the Morning, made atonement for the iniquities that were done in the Night; and the Evening. Sacrifice made atonement for the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that were by Day. This daily, <hi>dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sacrifice</hi> and Service, is a good Pattern for <hi>double Devotion</hi> every Day.</p>
               <p>We muſt acknowledge every Day the ſins of that Day; and we ſhould do well daily to make a particular Confeſſion of ſome of the greateſt and fouleſt, moſt heinous and groſs ſins, which we know we have committed in any part of our Lives: Theſe we muſt confeſs again and again, till we have gotten ſome Aſſurance of their Pardon, ſome comfortable Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God's Love; and if we attain to this in ſome good meaſure, yet let us confeſs our ſins ſtill, to get further and higher degrees of it, to get ſtronger and clearer confirmation of it: (as we ſee <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> does, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 51.) Yea, tho' we be never ſo <hi>fully</hi> perſwaded of the forgiveneſs of our ſins, yet let's confeſs them ſtill, that ſo our Pardon may be continued, and our Humility encreaſed, by often remembring
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:35226:114"/> what we <hi>were,</hi> as well as conſidering what we <hi>are;</hi> and that the Riches of God's free Grace may be thankfully acknowledged, and deſervedly magnified, in that he was pleas'd to remit and forgive ſuch heinous and <hi>provoking Offences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let's every Day pray, and ſay, <hi>This Day</hi> forgive us our Treſpaſſes: We ſhall reap and receive a <hi>threefold</hi> benefit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by it;</p>
               <p n="1">1. By daily Confeſſion, we ſhall keep our ſelves <hi>conſtantly humble,</hi> and daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new, and ſtrengthen our Obligation to continual Mortification, Watchfulneſs and Holineſs; and ſhall, by degrees, even ſhame our ſelves out of our ſins and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies: And this will make us every day afraid to ſin, when we know we muſt go before the <hi>Judge,</hi> and accuſe our ſelves, and aggravate our ſin, <hi>the very day</hi> the fault is done.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>more</hi> we do <hi>now,</hi> the <hi>leſs</hi> we ſhall have to do <hi>hereafter:</hi> If we confeſs our daily ſins <hi>every day of our life,</hi> the <hi>leſs work</hi> we ſhall have lying upon our hands at the <hi>day of our Death.</hi> And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to be <hi>before-hand</hi> in this Duty, this is
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:35226:115"/> one way to go <hi>quietly</hi> out of the World. When Men put off all to a late and <hi>Death-Bed</hi> Confeſſion, this makes them have ſuch an <hi>hard time</hi> of it; this makes their paſſage troubleſome; then they have the Devil, and a guilty Conſcience, to deal withal, which is worſe than to grapple, and conflict with their Diſeaſes; then their neglect, and ſhameful omiſſion of former Confeſſion, will torment and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie them, and the great <hi>uncertainty</hi> of their preſent <hi>Sincerity;</hi> and a ſtrong <hi>Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion,</hi> leſt the <hi>Principle</hi> of their action ſhould only be the paſſion of <hi>Fear,</hi> will diſhearten and <hi>diſcourage</hi> them, diſtract and confound them. Don't make the time of thy Death, the only time for thy full Confeſſion; perhaps, then thou may'ſt not be able to ſpeak for thy Sickneſs, nor to think of any thing as thou ſhouldſt do. O what wilt thou do to remember thy ſins, then when thy Memory fails thee? When we lie upon a Sick Bed, when our Bodies are <hi>weak,</hi> and our Memory <hi>craſie,</hi> is that a fit time to go over our Life, and to review the ſeveral parts of it? Therefore, that we may have the <hi>leſs</hi> to do, when we ſhall have <hi>enough</hi> to do to ſtruggle with Sickneſs; that we may have
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:35226:115"/> 
                  <hi>nothing</hi> to do when we die, but to die, and comfortably to yield up our ſelves to God, let us take this good Counſel, To be punctual in daily Confeſſion, and Self-Condemnation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yea, to accuſtom our ſelves to <hi>daily</hi> Confeſſion a <hi>contrite,</hi> not a meer <hi>cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary</hi> Confeſſion) it would be an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent means to free us from the <hi>Fear,</hi> the ſlaviſh, afflicting, tormenting fear of <hi>ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Death.</hi> To make all even, Morning and Evening, between God and our own Conſciences, by humble acknowledgment of all our Offences, and hearty Prayer for Pardon and Grace, for the ſake and Merits of the Mediator; <hi>this</hi> is the way to walk abroad, with <hi>Comfort</hi> and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, every day, without any fear of a <hi>ſudden Stroke,</hi> and haſty <hi>Arreſt</hi> by the Hand of <hi>Death;</hi> and to lie down in peace, and ſleep moſt quietly every Night, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out one anxious, diſtracting thought, where we ſhall awake the very next Morning; whether ever any more in this, or whether ſpeedily, or unexpectedly, in the other World. If we judge our ſelves in the preſence of God, and ſue out a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don at the Throne of Grace, and wiſely
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:35226:116"/> make our peace with Heaven, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile our ſelves to our Adverſary, day by day, we ſhall not be afraid of appearing immediately before God's <hi>Tribunal,</hi> and the Judgment-ſeat of Jeſus Chriſt, but ſhall be well prepar'd, and equally provided for longer Life, or preſent Death, and the Judgment to come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Death. Confeſs <hi>Daily;</hi> That's the ſecond.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And more particularly; Then make an humble, and hearty Confeſſion, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you lie under any <hi>notable Conviction.</hi> Confeſs thy ſin, upon any <hi>ſtrong</hi> and <hi>ſtirring</hi> Conviction of the Spirit, whether in the hearing, or reading of the Word, or in the uſe of Meditation, or upon Admonition, or occaſionally by any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; as when you ſee others puniſhed for the ſame ſins you are guilty of. When ever your Heart <hi>ſmites</hi> you, and Conſcience <hi>checks</hi> you for ſin, then it is a fit time to confeſs. When <hi>David</hi>'s Heart ſmote him, after that he had numbred the People, <hi>David</hi> preſently ſaid unto the Lord,<note n="*" place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.10.</note> 
                  <hi>I have ſinned greatly in that I have done.</hi> And ſo, when <hi>Nathan</hi> clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinc'd <hi>David</hi> of his ſin, and told
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:35226:116"/> him plainly,<note n="*" place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12, 7, &amp; 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou art the man,</hi> then preſently <hi>David</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Nathan,</hi>* <hi>I have ſinned againſt the Lord.</hi> Confeſs thy ſin, upon any <hi>ſound Conviction</hi> of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, for the <hi>quenching</hi> of the Spirit, is the ready way to make you ſin on, till you are <hi>paſt feeling,</hi> and to provoke God to reſolve that his Spirit ſhall <hi>ſtrive no longer</hi> with you.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Then make a ſerious and ſolemn Confeſſion, when ever you lie under any <hi>notable Affliction.</hi> This is a ſpecial Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of Confeſſion. As the Light of Conviction leads us to confeſs, ſo the Voice of the Rod leſſons us to confeſs too. Thus <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Brethren, when they were under a ſtrong <hi>Conviction,</hi> and in a great <hi>Strait,</hi> then they confeſs their Sin in ſelling their Brother. <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.21. <hi>And they ſaid, we are verily guilty concerning our Brother, in that we ſaw the anguiſh of his Soul when he beſought us; and we would not hear: therefore is this Diſtreſs come upon us. David</hi> thought this a <hi>fit Seaſon</hi> to confeſs: When the <hi>Plague</hi> lay upon his People for <hi>his Sin,</hi> then he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd it. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.17. <hi>And David ſpake into the Lord when he ſaw the Angel
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:35226:117"/> that ſmote the People, and ſaid, Lo, I have ſinned, and I have done wickedly: but theſe Sheep, what have they done?</hi> So <hi>David</hi> again, when <hi>his bones waxed old thro' his roaring all the day long; when day and night God's hand was heavy upon him, and his moiſture was turned into the drought of ſummer;</hi> then, ſays <hi>David, I acknowledged my Sin unto thee, and mine Iniquity have I not hid,</hi> Pſalm 32.3.4, 5. The Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> aſſembled themſelves with faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and confeſſed their ſins, and the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities of their Fathers, when God's hand lay heavy upon them, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9. And ſo the <hi>Prodigal,</hi> when he was in want, and ready to periſh with hunger, then he ſaid, <hi>I will ariſe, and go to my father, and will ſay unto him, Father I have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt heaven, and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son.</hi> (Luke 15.17, 18.) The time of <hi>Affliction</hi> is as <hi>proper</hi> a time for <hi>Confeſſion</hi> as any; God does then call on us aloud to ſet upon the Duty. When our ſin has found us out, and we eat the fruit of our own way, <hi>this</hi> is a time to glorifie and juſtifie God, by accuſing and condemning our ſelves, and acknowledging <hi>our ſelves</hi> to be the <hi>only Authors</hi> and Cauſes of our Sin,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:35226:117"/> and <hi>our Sin</hi> to be the only <hi>Meritorious,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing <hi>Cauſe</hi> of all our Puniſhment. Yet let's be ſure here, that we make our Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment and Affliction, not the <hi>Ground</hi> and <hi>Principle,</hi> but only the <hi>Occaſion</hi> and <hi>Opportunity</hi> of our Confeſſion. The time of Affliction is a <hi>ſeaſonable,</hi> and an <hi>accept ble</hi> time of Confeſſion; as <hi>then</hi> God looks it, ſo has he <hi>then</hi> a moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and ſavourable Reſpect to it. We find God pities the penitent Sinner that falls to Confeſſion in a day of Affliction. He has promis'd<note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.6.</note> to <hi>exalt and lift up them, that humble themſelves under his mighty hand.</hi> And that of <hi>Elihu</hi> is a <hi>great truth,</hi> Job 33.27, 28. <hi>He looketh upon men, and if any ſay, I have ſinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not;</hi> (yea, it was the Cauſe of my ſore Sickneſs, or ſad Trouble; and ſo was not only ſimply <hi>unprofitable,</hi> but very <hi>hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> and prejudicial to me: If any Sinner ſincerely and ſeriouſly ſay thus to God) <hi>he will deliver his Soul</hi> (that is <hi>himſelf) from going into the pit,</hi> (or <hi>grave) and his life ſhall ſee the light.</hi> A <hi>Periphraſis</hi> of <note n="†" place="margin">

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:35226:118"/> chearing thing in the World. God will bring the humble Confitent out of Trouble, and prolong his Life: He ſhall recover of his Sickneſs, or eſcape his Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and live longer to behold the <hi>Light</hi> of the Sun.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Confeſs <hi>preſently</hi> upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of any <hi>groſs</hi> and <hi>great Sin:</hi> For here, ſpeedy Confeſſion will be an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual means to keep Conſcience <hi>tender;</hi> and will certainly prevent that <hi>hardneſs,</hi> which would otherwiſe eaſily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted.

               <p n="2">2. Concerning the <hi>Place,</hi> where we ſhould confeſs, take this Direction. Let's eſpecially confeſs our Sins in <hi>ſecret.</hi> We ought indeed to take all Occaſions and Opportunities to join with others in <hi>Publick</hi> Confeſſion, to bear a part in the ordinary and extraordinary Confeſſions of the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Family</hi> to which we belong: But let's chiefly chuſe to make Confeſſion of Sin in <hi>Secret,</hi> between God and our Selves alone. And that for a Threefold Reaſon.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe <hi>private</hi> Confeſſion is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>neceſſary.</hi> For every Man has ſome <hi>perſonal, particular, ſpecial Sins,</hi> with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:35226:120"/> 
                  <hi>Circumſtances</hi> of them, that cannot be mentioned, when we pray, or join in Prayer, with others. If any other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, or compoſe the Prayer, he cannot confeſs them, becauſe <hi>he</hi> is <hi>ignorant</hi> of them, and a ſtranger to them: <hi>For what man knoweth the things of a man, ſave the Spirit of man, which is in him?</hi> (1 Cor. 2.11.)</p>
               <p>Again; If you your ſelves do draw up the Indictment, and frame the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; you will be ſure to conceal your moſt <hi>ſhameful</hi> Sins: You will never <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularize,</hi> never <hi>aggravate</hi> them in <hi>others hearing:</hi> Nor is it reaſonable you should. Secret Confeſſion is therefore <hi>neceſſary,</hi> for if <hi>ſome ſecret</hi> Sins be not confeſs'd in <hi>Secret,</hi> they will <hi>never</hi> be confeſs'd. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers can't, and we won't <hi>openly</hi> confeſs them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As <hi>ſecret</hi> Confeſſion is plainly <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,</hi> ſo, it is very <hi>Convenient.</hi> We have a double Advantage in <hi>Solitary,</hi> which we have not in <hi>ſocial</hi> Confeſſion. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. We may more fully and freely ſpread and lay open our Sins before God in <hi>Secret,</hi> than we are likely to do in
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:35226:120"/> 
                  <hi>Company</hi> with others. We cannot but be hugely <hi>loth</hi> to uncover our Nakedneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Men. We are afraid to reveal and open our <hi>Secrets</hi> to others: Becauſe if, in confeſſion of Sin, we ſhould enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and aggravate, before others, ſuch Faults and Miſcarriages, as we have been guilty of, but they ſuſpected nothing at all of before; ev'n they who hitherto thought well of us, would be apt to abandon their good Opinion of us, and might be ready to judge and condemn us, and to take up and harbour <hi>hard thoughts of us.</hi> Therefore we find our Selves very much <hi>heart-bound,</hi> and <hi>tongue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty'd</hi> in the preſence of others, as to the confeſſion of <hi>perſonal, private, particular</hi> Sins. But now nothing can hinder our <hi>Freedom</hi> in <hi>Secret:</hi> There we may deal as <hi>plainly</hi> as we will: There we may <hi>ſafely</hi> ſpeak <hi>all out:</hi> For we can never make our ſelves <hi>more vile</hi> and baſe, in the moſt ample true Confeſſion of our Sins to God, than God himſelf does know we are, more clearly and fully than our ſelves do, before we give him a ſad and ſorrowful Account of our Selves, make any relation of the wickedneſs of our Lives, or utter a word in ſecret Confeſſion
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:35226:121"/> of Sin to him. And, to be ſure, he'll not diſlike us, and turn away his Face from us, for the heinouſneſs of the Sins that are humbly acknowledged by us; but will favour us, and be well affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, for faithfully declaring our Sins, and thorowly unboſoming our Selves to him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Secret</hi> Confeſſion is moſt <hi>Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent;</hi> becauſe in <hi>Secret</hi> we have Liberty to uſe more Helps of <hi>Voice,</hi> and <hi>Geſture;</hi> and to acknowledge our Sins, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain againſt our Selves, with <hi>more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions</hi> of <hi>Shame,</hi> and <hi>Sorrow,</hi> and <hi>Anger,</hi> and holy <hi>Revenge.</hi> The poor penitent Sinner, when withdrawn from others, and gotten by himſelf alone, may uſe Self-puniſhing troubleſome Poſtures in his <hi>Confeſſions</hi> and <hi>Prayers:</hi> He may greatly humble himſelf, not only by the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Geſture of Genuflection, but by the moſt lowly, ſelf-abaſing Poſture of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration; not only fall on his Knees, but fall on his Face, before God. He may give a <hi>large vent</hi> to his ſtrong and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment holy Affections, in a choſen Place of convenient <hi>Privacy,</hi> and fit <hi>Retirement.</hi> There he may <hi>ſmite</hi> upon his <hi>Thigh,</hi> ſmite
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:35226:121"/> upon his <hi>Breast.</hi> There he may ſigh and groan, mourn and mone, weep and wail; confeſs and pray with <hi>ſtrong crying and tears;</hi> weep bitterly, and pour out tears abundantly; which things he refrains himſelf from, and forbears to do, in the preſence and company, ſight or hearing of others.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Confeſs in <hi>Secret;</hi> becauſe, the moſt <hi>ſecret</hi> is likely to be the moſt <hi>ſincere</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. We find in Scripture, that meer <hi>Hypocrites</hi> have made Confeſſion of their Sins <hi>before Men. Pharaoh</hi> did this to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> over and over; and <hi>Saul</hi> to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel;</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> himſelf before the Prieſts and Elders publickly in the Temple. But you don't read, that any of theſe would ever wait upon God in Secret, and there <hi>ingenuouſly</hi> pour out their Hearts before him. And therefore our Saviour requires, and preſſes Privacy in the Duty of Prayer, particularly. (<hi>Mat.</hi> 6.5, 6.) Confeſs thy ſins in <hi>Secret,</hi> where thou haſt no other <hi>Witneſs</hi> but the <hi>Lord himſelf;</hi> and nothing is done for gaining the <hi>Praiſe</hi> and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of <hi>Men,</hi> for <hi>Parts,</hi> or <hi>Piety</hi> and Devotion, which do not in the leaſt appear, and are not at all ſhewn to others,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:35226:122"/> in ſuch <hi>private</hi> Religious Performances. To confeſs and pray in private; to wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle with God <hi>all alone,</hi> and to ſupplicate in Secret, when no Eye of Man ſees thee, no Ear of Man hears thee; <hi>this</hi> will more plainly and clearly diſcover an upright and <hi>honeſt Heart</hi> in thee.</p>
               <p>When a Man does it in <hi>Secret,</hi> only between God and his own Soul, it is ſome <hi>Sign</hi> he confeſſes voluntarily and freely. It ſhews, that the Man is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd he has wrong'd God, and is ſorry for the Wrong he has done him, and would fain be Friends with him. Let's bring our Selves to the Teſt here: Let us try our Sincerity by this very Mark. We can go in Secret, to <hi>commit</hi> Sin; but do we get into Secret to <hi>confeſs</hi> it? We can be <hi>vile</hi> and wicked in <hi>private,</hi> but can we be <hi>penitent</hi> in <hi>private</hi> too? Do we know what belongs to ſecret <hi>Confeſſion?</hi> I'm afraid the moſt of us are <hi>practically</hi> igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of this Duty. But if <hi>we</hi> can enter into our <hi>Cloſet,</hi> and, when we have ſhut the Door, be free with our Father in <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret; This</hi> is likely to be an Argument and Teſtimony of our <hi>Sincerity.</hi> So much for your Direction concerning the <hi>Place</hi> where you ſhould confeſs.</p>

Then apply the Promiſe to thy ſelf, and make good <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of it in time of Temptation. <hi>(3.)</hi> Haſt thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd? Then daily plead the Promiſe with God, and carefully look after the Performance of it. <hi>(4.)</hi> Haſt thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd, and found and felt the Benefit of it? Why then, give God the Praiſe that is due to him. <hi>(5.)</hi> Haſt thou confeſs'd thy ſins? Then take great heed of falling into ſin after Confeſſion. And here, <hi>(1.)</hi> Take heed of falling wilfully into any ſin after Confeſſion. <hi>(2.)</hi> Beware, eſpecially, that you fall not wilfully into the ſame particular ſins you have confeſs'd: For, <hi>(1.)</hi> There is great danger of it. Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, <hi>(1.)</hi> To the formal Confeſſor, in four reſpects. <hi>(2.)</hi> Danger too to the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Confeſſor: <hi>(1.)</hi> From Satan. <hi>(2.)</hi> The greateſt danger from our own Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>(2.)</hi> There is great Evil and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in it; great Guilt and Danger by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:35226:123"/> of it. For <hi>(1.)</hi> falling into ſin after Confeſſion does exceedingly aggravate the ſin. Sin after Confeſſion, a great ſin in three reſpects. <hi>(2.)</hi> As this is a great ſin, ſo it brings along with it great Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; both internal and external Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments. <hi>(3.)</hi> Sinning wilfully after Confeſſion, will make you Self-condemn'd when God puniſheth you. <hi>(4.)</hi> 'Twill break our preſent Peace, and daſh our Hopes of future and further Comfort. <hi>(5.)</hi> Thou wilt thus cut out for thy ſelf new Work, and make the Severities of a New Repentance neceſſary. <hi>(6.)</hi> Falling into ſin after Confeſſion, will make us the more unapt and unable to riſe again, and recover out of it; it will ſtrengthen Sin, and weaken Grace in us. <hi>(7.)</hi> 'Twill very much diſhearten us, when we would beg Pardon of our ſin, and hugely diſcourage us when we would renew our Reſolution againſt it. <hi>(8.)</hi> 'Twill make God loth ever to take your Word again, and will render him harder to Pardon you upon a new Confeſſion.</head>
               <p>I Shall, in the laſt place, direct you in your Carriage and Behaviour <hi>after</hi> the Duty. And here I ſhall commend to you theſe following Directions:</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:35226:123"/>1. Haſt thou confeſs'd? Then <hi>Bleſs</hi> God, who has <hi>enabled</hi> thee to confeſs; who has put it into thy Heart to confeſs. And tho' thou art not yet ſenſible of the Receipt of Pardon, yet look upon it as a Sign and Token that God intends more good to thee, in that he has inclined and enabled thee to confeſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Haſt thou confeſs'd, and ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd the <hi>Condition?</hi> Then apply the <hi>Promiſe</hi> to thy ſelf, and make good uſe of it in time of <hi>Temptation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Lay hold upon the <hi>Promiſe;</hi> look upon the <hi>Promiſe</hi> as belonging to <hi>thee</hi> in <hi>particular:</hi> reckon thy ſelf really and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intereſted in it; and be bold to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge a part and ſhare in it, as well as any one elſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And further; Make good uſe of it in time of <hi>Temptation.</hi> If thou haſt been truly ſorrowful for thy ſins, and haſt hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily confeſs'd them to God; why then, when <hi>Satan</hi> vexes and moleſts thy Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, by laying the Law to thee, it will be profitable and comfortable to oppoſe <hi>Satan,</hi> to anſwer him, and reply upon

If the Devil object thy <hi>unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> to thee, tell him, That God does not Pardon any, becauſe they are <hi>Worthy</hi> or <hi>Deſerving,</hi> but becauſe he himſelf is <hi>Faithful</hi> and <hi>Juſt.</hi> If Satan tempt thee to diſtruſt here, take the courſe that<note n="†" place="margin">

If thou haſt the true Spirit of Confeſſion of Sin, it will reſt upon thee, and abide in thee afterwards, as the Spirit of ſincere Obedience to God's Commands, and Univerſal compliance with his Will. Let me exhort you in the Words of <hi>Ezra, Ezr.</hi> 10.11. <hi>Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make confeſſion unto the Lord God of thy fathers, and do his pleaſure.</hi> Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our Sins to God, and doing the Divine Pleaſure, muſt go together; our Confeſſion muſt be like that of <hi>David</hi>'s, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.26. <hi>I have declared my ways, and thou heardeſt; teach me thy ſtatutes.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we have confeſs'd, we ſhould deſire and endeavour to walk uprightly, and to learn God's Laws and Statutes: and ſhould abhor to live careleſly and looſly, and to run into ſin fearleſly and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly. Confeſſion and Repudiation, and Renunciation of ſin, <hi>Confeſſion</hi> and <hi>Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of ſin, muſt go together; it is not,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:35226:125"/> who ſo <hi>barely</hi> confeſſeth, but, <hi>Who ſo confeſſeth and forſaketh his ſins, ſhall have mercy,</hi> Prov. 28.13. We are too ready to think, that we have done all, as ſoon as ever we have confeſs'd; and that what remains, is only God's acting of his Part; when as you ſee the Promiſe runs thus: <hi>Who ſo confeſſeth and forſaketh his ſins, ſhall have mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Advice I ſhall give you, I ſhall lay before you in two Particulars. Let me faſten this double Word of Counſel on you:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Take heed of falling <hi>wilfully</hi> into <hi>any</hi> ſin <hi>after</hi> Confeſſion; for he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes ſin aright, confeſſes <hi>Sin</hi> as <hi>Sin,</hi> with a real hatred of, ſhame and ſorrow for <hi>Sin as Sin,</hi> and ſo is engag'd againſt <hi>all Sin</hi> whatſoever. Hate even the Garment ſpotted by the fleſh; Hate every falſe way. But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Beware eſpecially, that ye fall not <hi>wilfully</hi> into the <hi>ſame</hi> particular ſins ye have confeſs'd. Let's take heed of the <hi>Repetition</hi> and Recommiſſion of the very <hi>ſame</hi> fault after Confeſſion. Take heed of this, for,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:35226:126"/>1. There is great Danger <hi>of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There is great <hi>Evil,</hi> and <hi>Folly</hi> in it; great <hi>Guilt,</hi> and <hi>Danger</hi> by reaſon of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There's great danger <hi>of it;</hi> of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to the <hi>ſame</hi> Sin again after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
               <p>Danger to the <hi>formal;</hi> and</p>

               <p n="1">1. For ſuch, who have often confeſt their Sins without any true Senſe of Sin: Why that you may not now fall into any of thoſe Sins, which you have ſo <hi>ſlightly</hi> confeſt, and are therefore in ſo much <hi>danger</hi> of: Be ſure, you labour ſpeedily to get a <hi>deep</hi> and <hi>thorough Conviction</hi> of the <hi>Evil</hi> of your Sins. Think, and ſay thus within thy Self: I ha' ſometime <hi>cuſtomarily</hi> confeſt my Sin to God; but O what a great and <hi>heinous</hi> Sin is it? How <hi>contrary</hi> to God's expreſs <hi>Command?</hi> What heavy <hi>Threatnings</hi> are plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd in the Book of God againſt it? How <hi>croſs</hi> is this and that Sin even to the Light of my own <hi>Nature?</hi> How con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the clear Light of <hi>Scripture?</hi> What a <hi>Grief</hi> to the Good <hi>Spirit</hi> of God? What a <hi>Breach</hi> of comely and beautiful <hi>Order</hi> in the World? What a <hi>Diſcredit</hi> to my Profeſſion? What an <hi>ill Example</hi> to my Neighbours, Servants, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? What a <hi>Wound</hi> to my Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? What a <hi>Breach</hi> in my Peace?
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:35226:134"/> What an <hi>Enemy</hi> to the life of my poor Soul? I ſay, that you may not deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately run into <hi>old</hi> Sins, and ſo contract <hi>new</hi> Guilt; labour preſently to get, and <hi>beg of God</hi> that he would give you, a deep and thorough <hi>Conviction</hi> of thoſe Sins, which you have formerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, without any Sight or Senſe of Sin. But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. If any among us have confeſt our Sins, with a <hi>true Senſe</hi> of Sin upon our Spirits; why that we may not relapſe, and fall back again into the very <hi>ſame</hi> Sins we have particularly confeſt; let us carefully obſerve, and diligently pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe theſe following <hi>Rules.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Labour to <hi>preſerve</hi> and maintain, in the Courſe of thy Life, the <hi>ſame</hi> Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions thou hadſt of thy Sin, in any <hi>former</hi> ſerious and ſolemn Confeſſion. Surely, you did not then look upon Sin as it was mask'd and vizarded, and had the Notion of <hi>good</hi> put upon't; as it ſeem'd <hi>profitable, pleaſurable, honourable:</hi> But you then look'd upon the <hi>naked na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of Sin, and the <hi>ſad conſequences</hi> of it: You then apprehended the <hi>Evil</hi> that is
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:35226:135"/> 
                  <hi>in it,</hi> and diſcern'd the Evil that comes <hi>after it,</hi> and follows upon it. You then ſaw Sin, as Men uſe to ſee it at the <hi>day of Death,</hi> when they are well <hi>awaken'd:</hi> You then ſaw it after the ſame manner, as the <hi>damn'd</hi> in Hell ſee it: You then ſaw it, in ſome good meaſure, as <hi>God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> ſees it: You then thought of it, as <hi>holy Men</hi> do, when they are <hi>enlighten'd</hi> by God's Spirit: You then judg'd of it, as your <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf, when he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd upon the <hi>Croſs,</hi> and felt the weight of his Father's <hi>Wrath</hi> for your Sin, judg'd of it: You then ſpake of it, as the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> it ſelf, as the <hi>Spirit</hi> in the Scripture ſpeaks of it: As the Righteous and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Law-Giver</hi> himſelf expreſſes himſelf concerning it in his Word: You then <hi>felt</hi> the pain and <hi>ſmart</hi> of it, and call'd it an <hi>evil</hi> and a <hi>bitter thing,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.19.</note> and <hi>befool'd</hi> your ſelf for medling with it: You <hi>then</hi> had a graat <hi>Prejudice</hi> of Mind, a ſtrong <hi>Antipathy</hi> of Heart againſt it; and fully <hi>reſolv'd,</hi> in the very <hi>Preſence</hi> and Hearing of God himſelf, <hi>never</hi> to have any more to do with it.</p>
               <p>O keep theſe <hi>ſevere</hi> Thoughts <hi>freſh</hi> ſtill: Never ſuffer them to wear off a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain:
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:35226:135"/> This will certainly <hi>ſowr</hi> and <hi>imbit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> Sin to you, and make you ha' no mind to it, and cauſe you to find <hi>no pleaſure</hi> and delight at all in it; no more than in <hi>Gall</hi> and <hi>Wormwood;</hi> no more than in <hi>Wounds,</hi> and <hi>Bruiſes;</hi> in <hi>Aches,</hi> and <hi>Pains,</hi> and <hi>broken Bones.</hi> The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the <hi>Bitterneſs</hi> of Sin, which we fully <hi>felt</hi> in Confeſſion of Sin, will effectually preſerve in our Minds and Hearts a conſtant <hi>diſgust</hi> and diſreliſhing of Sin, an utter diſaffection to it, a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal condemnation of it, and an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute averſation from it. It's very potent to reſtrain and deter us from yielding to it, or ever cloſing any more with it: 'Twill make us diſallow it now <hi>at preſent,</hi> as <hi>then</hi> we diſallow'd it.</p>
               <p>This very Conſideration, will eaſily repel that <hi>notable Temptation</hi> of <hi>Satan;</hi> wherein he goes about to draw us to Sin, by perſwading us of the <hi>Eaſineſs</hi> and facility of getting a <hi>Pardon</hi> upon <hi>reiterated</hi> Confeſſion. Thou maiſt ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to Sin again, ſays he, it is but Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing again. Now the lively <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance</hi> of what we formerly felt in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing, aſſures us, that Confeſſion (which
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:35226:136"/> the Devil makes but a <hi>but</hi> of) is as <hi>hard</hi> and difficult a Piece of Work as can be: That it's no ſuch <hi>eaſie</hi> matter to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs: That this is a grievous <hi>Penalty,</hi> a pungent, <hi>afflictive Duty.</hi> When <hi>Satan</hi> tempts one after Confeſſion; if the Man be ſtill ſenſible of his Sin, and of the Evil of it; the <hi>Devil</hi> then finds but <hi>poor</hi> Entertainment: What, ſays the Soul, Art thou, the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of all my <hi>Torments,</hi> come again? Surely a <hi>bloody</hi> Maſter haſt thou been unto me, and now thou dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeekeſt ſubtilly to <hi>devour</hi> me. What, would you have me Sin <hi>again,</hi> and ſo be wretched and miſerable for <hi>ever?</hi> Or ſay you, I may Repent, and Confeſs again afterwards? I know then too too well already what it will coſt me: I well remember the <hi>Shame,</hi> and <hi>Sorrow,</hi> and <hi>Self-Revenge,</hi> that muſt be acted and exercis'd in that Duty: <hi>Non tanti emam poenitere:</hi> I'll not buy Repentance at ſo <hi>dear</hi> a Rate. This is the firſt <hi>Rule;</hi> That you may not Sin after Confeſſion, be ſure you <hi>continue</hi> the <hi>ſame</hi> Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion you had of your Sin under ſome notable <hi>Conviction,</hi> in any <hi>former</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:35226:136"/>2. That thou maiſt not hereafter <hi>wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> fall into any particular Sin already confeſt; ſeriouſly conſider and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, That thou art at preſent in <hi>depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance</hi> upon God for <hi>Mercy,</hi> and art very <hi>fair</hi> for't. And therefore think thus with thy Self: How dare I do this, and diſhonour him afreſh, from whom I <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſo much?</hi> Won't my <hi>repeating</hi> of this Sin <hi>deaden</hi> my Hopes, and <hi>fruſtrate</hi> my Expectations? Can I think, that God will <hi>love</hi> and own, <hi>favour</hi> and tender me <hi>after this?</hi> Will God ſpeak <hi>Peace</hi> to my Soul, if I <hi>return</hi> again to <hi>Folly?</hi> Will God comfort my Conſcience, and <hi>cheer my Spirit,</hi> if I churliſhly ſad and <hi>grieve his Spirit?</hi> Will God waſh and <hi>cleanſe me,</hi> if I wilfully defile and <hi>pollute my ſelf?</hi> This very Meditation will in a great meaſure <hi>diſcourage</hi> and diſhearten, curb and reſtrain you from ſinning; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally from <hi>relapſing</hi> into any Sin <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly</hi> confeſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That we may not fall into Sins confeſt, Let's be always <hi>imploring Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Aſſiſtance,</hi> and <hi>improving our own En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours</hi> againſt them. Let's heartily
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:35226:137"/> beg God's <hi>Grace,</hi> and earneſtly ſeek the Lord and his <hi>Strength,</hi> and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <hi>uſe</hi> Grace receiv'd, and up and be doing, and go and <hi>act</hi> in the <hi>Strength</hi> of the Lord. Let's apprehend our ſelves in <hi>danger</hi> of every <hi>Corruption,</hi> of every <hi>Temptation;</hi> and be afraid leſt any Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation ſhould blow out the Light of former Conviction; and allay the Heat, and abate the Strength of former Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and draw us to return again to <hi>Folly.</hi> Let's every Day watch and pray, that we enter not into Temptation: Let's be ſober and vigilant, becauſe our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary the <hi>Devil,</hi> as a <hi>roaring Lion,</hi> walketh about, ſeeking how he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour us. Let's manfully reſiſt the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt Temptations to the Sins we ha' con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt; ſhun all Occaſions, and abſtain from all Appearance of Evil; and exerciſe Self-denial, and labour betimes to break our ſelves of our own Wills: Let's daily obſerve the very firſt <hi>riſings,</hi> and motions and ſtirrings of <hi>thoſe Sins</hi> in our Hearts, which at any time we have confeſt and repented of: And let's remember and conſider, how they formerly won and gain'd upon us; and let's reſiſt their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>beginnings,</hi> and nip them in the very

                  <hi>bud,</hi> and cruſh the very Coccatrice <hi>Eggs.</hi> Let's not entertain any <hi>old Sin,</hi> ſo much as in our <hi>Fancy:</hi> Let's never venture to keep it's <hi>Picture,</hi> nor once offer to wear it's <hi>Favor:</hi> Let's bear no loving, <hi>pleaſing remembrance</hi> of it, nor ſhew any <hi>kind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect</hi> to it; but expreſs the higheſt <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like</hi> of it, and the moſt implacable, irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilable <hi>Enmity</hi> againſt it.</p>
               <p>So much for the <hi>Means</hi> or <hi>Helps,</hi> in the Uſe of which we may keep our Selves from foully and wilfully falling into Sins confeſt.</p>

               <p>I Shall ſhut up this Direction with theſe two <hi>Cautions:</hi>

                  </note> While <hi>Fools</hi> avoid <hi>one Vice,</hi> they commonly ruſh into the <hi>contrary</hi> Vice: Let's therefore take heed, that ſin don't <hi>in again</hi> in our very <hi>Revenge</hi> of thoſe ſins which we ha' confeſs'd. Here <hi>Satan</hi> always ſeeks his Advantages, and often gets them of us, and makes too good uſe of them when he has got them.

But tho' the caſe be <hi>dangerous,</hi> yet it is not <hi>deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate;</hi> tho' you be <hi>further</hi> from Pardon than ever upon ſo doing, yet God <hi>can</hi> pardon you in and through Chriſt.</p>
               <p>There is not any <hi>one word</hi> in Scripture, that affirms or intimates, that Perſons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſing,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:35226:140"/> tho' again and again, into the ſame ſin, can never truly and ſincerely repent. Nor is there any <hi>one word</hi> to be found there, that denies the benefit of <hi>Goſpel-pardon</hi> to thoſe that humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, and unfeignedly repent of ſuch ſins as theſe. Yea, there are ſuch <hi>ſweet paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> and <hi>precious promiſes</hi> contain'd in Scripture, as will undoubtedly ſupport and uphold any poor Soul in this ſtate and condition, and keep him from utter <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing</hi> of Pardon. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.12, 13. <hi>Go, and proclaim theſe words toward the north, and ſay, Return thou backſliding Iſrael, ſaith the Lord, and I will not cauſe mine anger to fall upon you: for I am merciful, ſaith the Lord, and I will not keep anger for ever. Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou haſt tranſgreſſed againſt the Lord thy God.</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 22. <hi>Return ye backſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding children, and I will heal your back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings.</hi> This is the gracious Promiſe, and merciful Invitation of God: Now do but obſerve their Anſwer; <hi>Behold, we come unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God.</hi> The <hi>greatneſs</hi> of their <hi>Sin</hi> does not drive them to <hi>Deſpair;</hi> but the <hi>greatneſs</hi> and graciouſneſs of God's <hi>Promiſe</hi> does embolden and <hi>encourage</hi> them to come to

Let us then freely <hi>forgive</hi> thoſe that have treſpaſs'd againſt <hi>us,</hi> upon <hi>their Confeſſion</hi> of their faults to us.

But if he turn and confeſs, <hi>expreſs</hi> and <hi>manifeſt</hi> his Repentance and Sorrow, by being <hi>ready,</hi> to his <hi>power,</hi> to make <hi>amends,</hi> then muſt we <hi>not only</hi> forgive him in our <hi>Hearts,</hi> but <hi>ſo</hi> forgive him, as to <hi>declare</hi> and expreſs, <hi>profeſs</hi> and teſtify to him, our full forgiveneſs of the private wrong, and particular injury done unto us by him.

               </p>
               <p>Be you ſure to forgive thoſe that confeſs to you, whether you have found the good of Confeſſion yet or no. If you have got ſome comfortable perſwaſion of the Pardon of your Sins, do you then forgive others as God <hi>has</hi> forgiven you: If yet you want the ſence and inward teſtimony of this, why then forgive as you <hi>would</hi> be forgiven, and as you <hi>hope</hi> God will forgive you upon your Confeſſion. If thy repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Brother confeſs to thee his treſpaſs againſt thee; be thou, in obedience to Chriſt's command, <hi>faithful</hi> and <hi>juſt</hi> to <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him;</hi> and, as far as in thee lies, to <hi>cleanſe him</hi> from his unrighteouſneſs; and then thou may'ſt more comfortably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that upon Confeſſion of thy Sins to God, he will be <hi>faithful</hi> and <hi>juſt</hi> to <hi>forgive thee</hi> thy Sins, and to <hi>cleanſe thee</hi> from all unrighteouſneſs.</p>
